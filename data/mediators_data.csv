Halee Burg,halee@elderdecisions.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Halee-Burg,,Agreement Resources/Elder Decisions,"The primary focus of my practice is mediation within the family context. Family mediations address conflicts or concerns regarding issues involving adult families, elders, adult siblings, estates and trusts, caregiving, divorce, parenting, post-divorce matters, and small family businesses. I also mediate disputes between couples who wish to remain married, unmarried cohabitants, neighbors, and/or friends. Outside the family realm, I mediate conflicts/concerns between co-workers, employees and managers, contractors and customers, or other providers of professional services and their clients or customers. My goal is to engage each party in having the best possible discussion about the issues of concern to them, and to support parties in working toward collaborative, mutually agreeable, and durable solutions.
  
My career has spanned the spectrum of conflict resolution, from the most adversarial to the most collaborative dispute resolution methods. As an eager young lawyer, I practiced as a trial attorney for several years in a large law firm. It did not take long before I realized that litigation was far too often an expensive, inefficient, time-consuming, and stressful approach to resolving disputes, often leaving all parties feeling dissatisfied, disenchanted with the courts, and with damaged personal or professional relationships. I moved on to work in the field of alternative dispute resolution, and have focused my work exclusively on mediation.

","I encourage people to consider mediation as a way to resolve issues more quickly, more efficiently, more economically, and with greater satisfaction. Mediation participants find that they are able to build creative, lasting solutions that support personal, family or professional relationships and reduce stress.

I view my role as helping parties navigate the slippery slopes of differences and conflict.

We facilitate interpersonal and business conversations and help parties find effective ways to communicate, determine the real issues to be resolved, separate emotions from finance, make informed decisions, and implement resolutions.
Our mediation practice backgrounds include: complex multi-party interpersonal disputes and team dynamics issues; equity split dilemmas; financially sophisticated cases; co-founder problems; founder-investor relations; graceful employee, founder, and executive level exits; mergers &amp;amp; acquisitions; family business matters; compensation &amp;amp; benefits; union related; financial and services/administrative issues; organizational, strategic, and mission related; values and ethics related.
&lt;b&gt;Our Approach:&lt;/b&gt;
If you or you team are in the midst of a conflict you are probably full of confusion, frustration and concern. You might be worried about losing money, clients, your job, your reputation, production capacity, and perhaps your own identity. We keep the mediation process simple and very focused on addressing your concerns. We do this by thoroughly examining the facts and issues, then we help you weigh all of your potential options in terms of both the emotional and financial impacts on you and your organization both now and in the future. We understand your worries and concerns and address them head on. In mediation, we provide you with the guidance and the tools to be in charge of your and your organizations' future.

Lisa Taylor,lisataylor@apeacefuldivorce.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Lisa-Taylor,,"Taylor-Made Solutions, PLLC","ONLINE MEDIATION AVAILABLE.I have conducted virtual mediations over the years as necessary when one spouse moved out of state or to a distant county. Given our current circumstances, I am thankful to have that experience. Online mediations allow face-to-face interactions that make you feel almost as if you are in the same room, and videoconferencing software has improved dramatically recently, allowing me to tailor the process as I would in person: for example, separating parties when it is helpful to do so, using &ldquo;waiting rooms&rdquo; and mute features.
More generally, I have been an attorney for over 25 years and a full-time mediator for more than 12 years. I have been very successful in helping couples amicably settle their divorces, avoiding the delays, excessive legal bills, and trauma that result from the traditional adversarial process. My clients protect their children from a court battle between their parents and protect themselves from years of lingering bitterness.So when people ask,   Why did you leave a successful litigation practice to begin a mediation firm?   the answer is simple: mediation is more fulfilling for me and for my clients. Instead of finding ways to weaken the other side, which was my job as a litigator, now I empower both sides so they can resolve disputes and move forward with their lives. A peaceful divorce is possible.
  
I became an attorney in 1988, graduating from the University of Michigan School of Law. In 1999, I experienced my own divorce and the emotional turmoil it created for my children and for me. That year, I took the training to become a civil mediator. However, I mediated only a few cases, because I became more heavily involved in litigation. Although I was successful, I did not feel fulfilled. Regardless of the number of &ldquo;wins&rdquo;, I realized that litigating is really &ldquo;lose-lose&rdquo; for everyone because of the costs in time, money, stress, and increased hostility. I stopped litigating to mediate full time. My clients usually leave each session smiling &amp;#8212; a result I did not see when litigating!
Regarding my education, I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan as well as my law degree. I trained as a mediator through the Institute of Continuing Legal Education (ICLE) and the Oakland Mediation Center, and completed the ICLE's family law Certificate program.
I have acted as a training coach for the Oakland Mediation Center's mediator training program and provided volunteer mediation services there.
I am the Secretary of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Section of the State Bar of Michigan.

I act as a neutral party, guiding the discussions and helping you stay focused and rational, providing a safe setting in which you can create options and find solutions.

With all information voluntarily provided, you are able to make informed decisions together without the animosity generated by the adversarial   discovery   process. No decision is made until it is acceptable to you both.&lt;/p&gt;
Once you reach agreement, I draft, with your input, a binding settlement agreement. If you desire, I will also help you understand the court process and the court documents. The judge will enter a Judgment of Divorce that incorporates the settlement agreement to finalize your divorce. The court proceeding is simplified, because all conflict has already been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
I am also available to help with post-divorce conflicts regarding parenting time, child support, alimony or implementation of the property division.&lt;/p&gt;

As Director of the Stein Mediation and Family Center, I have substantial, intensive training in mediation from New York University, the Ackerman Institute, and Community Mediation Services, Inc., and I have also completed intensive training in Couples and Family Therapy at the Ackerman Institute. I have also taught Child Development for years at the university level. I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).

We have lower fee slots available on a sliding scale basis and work hard not to let finances get in the way of services. We also offer a free initial 30 minute consultation. Please give us a call.&lt;/p&gt;
","I have years of experience in divorce and family mediation. In addition to my training as a Divorce Mediator, I find that my background as a Child Specialist allows me to bring into the room, if both parents are interested, helpful information about the best interests of the children that are relevant to a parenting schedule or parenting plan. Likewise, as a seasoned individual, family, and couples therapist, as well as a Divorce Coach with Collaborative Divorce, I can often help couples get through difficult emotions that may emerge during the mediation process which may otherwise derail the process.&lt;/p&gt;
","Mediation is about helping people understand the relevant issues and advocate a solution that respects different needs and works for everyone. I am committed to doing this in a respectful, sensitive, and impartial way.&lt;/p&gt;
I am knowledgeable about how the courts would likely resolve an issue, though I am most interested in helping people understand and explain their real needs&amp;#8211;as well as their children's&amp;#8211;so that they can craft a solution that is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;
I will ensure that all voices are heard and considered in any potential agreement. As a clinician, I am also sensitive to the emotional hot spots that tend to break things down in negotiation and will help individuals find a way around them so that they can reach a solution that will work now&amp;#8211;and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
","I have a Ph.D. in Public Health (behavioral sciences) from UCLA, as well as an M.S.W. in Social Work (clinical emphasis) from NYU. My dissertation was in the area of child sexual assault, and I have published extensively in the field of psychological sequelae of adult and child sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;

Les Wallerstein,leswallerstein@proton.me,,,Les Wallerstein: Mediator &amp, Family Lawyer,"My practice specializes in mediation and non-adversarial family law. I believe it is especially important to avoid the ravages of litigation when children are involved.
The majority of my mediation clients are actively seeking to divorce. I also mediate all of the following: pre-marital agreements (formerly known as prenuptial agreements), marital agreements i.e., conflicts between spouses who have not decided to divorce (formerly known as postnuptial agreements), post-divorce disputes and cohabitation (and co-tenancy) agreements between unmarried partners.
As collaborative counsel I am committed to the least adversarial practice of law possible. I believe collaborative legal representation offers the best hope for a non-adversarial resolution when mediation is not an option.
  
I am a practicing attorney with a master's degree in psychology. As a psychotherapist I worked with individuals, couples, families and groups for 20 years before becoming a lawyer. My professional background includes: Association for Conflict Resolution, Founding Member: 2001, Advanced Practitioner (Family Section): 2001 &ndash; 2009; Massachusetts Collaborative Law Council, Founding Member: 2000, Board of Directors: 2000 &ndash; 2004, Treasurer: 2000 &ndash; 2002, Co-founder &amp;amp; Co-editor of the Collaborative Law Journal: 2003 &ndash; 2006, Member: 2000 &amp;#8211; 2010; Massachusetts Council on Family Mediation, Member: 1993 &ndash; present, Board of Directors: 1993 &ndash; present, President: 2001 &ndash; 2002, Founder &amp;amp; Editor, Family Mediation Quarterly: 2002 &ndash; present, Certified Divorce Mediator: 1996 &ndash; present, and Massachusetts Justice of The Peace: 2008 &amp;#8211; present.

My hourly fee for divorce mediation is $350, and clients sign a fee agreement and pay $3,000 as a retainer at the beginning of the process. While all divorces are unique, if a couple owns one house, has two children and are committed to resolving their differences, they can expect their mediated divorce to cost in the neighborhood of $3,500. Most couples share the cost of their mediation.&lt;/p&gt;
","Since opening my mediation practice in 1992, I have mediated hundreds of divorces and related interpersonal conflicts with both traditional and non-traditional families.&lt;/p&gt;
","Mediating family disputes is at the heart of my practice. Believing that clients are the best experts on the life of their family, I focus on helping them craft fair and lasting settlements. Despite my client-centered approach, I will become actively engaged in the process when the parties approach an impasse. As a lawyer-mediator, I often draft all the court forms needed for a Massachusetts divorce. I encourage clients to do as much work as possible on their own to help minimize their mediation costs.&lt;/p&gt;

Mary Salisbury,mary@therightdivorcesolution.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Mary-Salisbury,,,"Most people think they have two choices when it comes to divorce: either get an attorney or go through a divorce on their own. Couples who have children, significant assets or who have been married for a significant period of time think that they have to hire an attorney to figure out how to divide up their assets, determine child or spousal support, or share parental time. That simply is not true. At The Right Divorce Solution, we believe in enhancing communication between all parties and focusing on cooperation vs. building conflict. This is a much healthier approach for everyone involved, including the children. My process does not involve giving you legal advice or guidance. It's my role to help you identify and discuss issues and to explore options and proposals for settlement. Using my services as a neutral with financial expertise allows couples to divorce much more affordably. It is very important that clients understand the long term financial implications of a proposed settlement. This is critical to understanding the effect on both parties, and their financial well being.
I also work with individuals who must litigate their divorce by providing support to their legal counsel for purposes of determining child or spousal support, facilitating the preparation of Qualified Domestic Relations Orders and/or determining the value of their separate property (usually pensions and investment accounts).
  
Mary Salisbury is a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst&reg; and the founder of The Right Divorce Solution, LLC. During her career as an independent financial advisor, Mary developed a passion for educating women, particularly widowed and divorced women, so they could understand their investments and finances and confidently plan for retirement. Mary has since narrowed the scope of her financial practice to helping individuals and couples as a divorce financial planner and mediator. She continues to use her financial expertise to help clients understand the long term financial implications of property division, child support and alimony and how that will integrate with their other sources of income, including Social Security. Mary's past experience includes a long career as an ERISA (employee benefits) paralegal in Dallas Texas, managing a large bankruptcy trustee practice in Los Angeles California and managing a veterinary hospital in southern California.

QDRO facilitation done for a flat fee.&lt;/p&gt;
","The majority of my practice is helping couples from their 30s to 60s work through dividing assets and determine how to raise their family as co-parents. I've helped individuals litigating their divorce, usually affluent women, prove their marital lifestyle by preparing a lifestyle analysis to provide to the court. I've helped individuals plan for divorce or just figure out what their life could look life so they could make a more informed decision about whether to divorce. I've helped individuals who married with assets they had already accumulated on their own calculate the value of their separate property.&lt;/p&gt;
","With the exception of child custody, divorce is a financial settlement and should be approached that way. I provide couples with the understanding of their after tax marital estate as well as income and expenses so that mediations can be done with both short term and long term information on how a proposed settlement will affect both parties. This information during mediation facilitates better understanding and helps avoid misunderstandings and promotes settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

In caucuses, we confidentially and constructively explore the strengths and weaknesses of the parties' cases, the best and worst and most likely alternatives to a negotiated agreement, the risks faced by each party if there is no settlement, and the costs of proceeding through trial.&lt;/p&gt;
I work with the parties to creatively brainstorm ideas and solutions and their settlement demands or offers and their later settlement moves with them, to help the parties reach a resolution that they can all accept. This may include business solutions as well as money demands and offers.&lt;/p&gt;
I prepare intensively in advance of each mediation session. I believe in outside the box approaches and relentless follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

","The mediation and legal communities, as well as the New Jersey courts, acknowledge Anju as one of the most experienced and competent mediators in the region. She is also active in training and mentoring mediators, and leads New Jersey Association of Professional Mediators' divorce mediation training programs, and is also an instructor in the New Jersey State Bar Association's 40-hour Divorce training.&lt;/p&gt;
","Most clients have similar issues they need to address such as the house, the pension, and college education for the children. I therefore follow the tenet that mediation can be approached in fairly structured manner so as to minimize mediation fees, maximize the productivity of sessions by keeping clients focused, and expedite a resolution before the conflict is allowed to escalate. Nevertheless, I also believe that the process should also be flexible to properly address the uniqueness of each couple's situation such as different religious requirements, or the needs of a gifted child. I have a facilitative style with a true belief in self-determination; I also has an eye towards settlement and am glad to provide resources that can help clients move towards resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

I strove to do a better job, both in result and in process, and found that mediating prenups was generally the most optimal first step. &nbsp;Eventually, I wrote many articles which are online (many on this website), and a book for people thinking about having one,   The Generous Prenup: How to Support Your Marriage and Avoid the Pitfalls,   which is available on Amazon. &nbsp;The book and my articles brought me many new clients all over the United States. &nbsp;At present, I concentrate my practice on prenups and postnups, mediating and consulting. &nbsp;I'm admitted to the bar in Massachusetts, so in Massachusetts I also represent clients negotiating prenups, as well as serving as a mediator and consultant. prenuptial and postnuptial agreements. I have many articles posted on The Huffington Post (now HuffPost) on these topics and others. My articles on prenups have also been published in the Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, and the New York Times, and I have been interviewed by a number of magazines on prenuptial agreements, including NY Magazine (The Cut).
  
I went to law school at age 38, and now have been practicing for over 35 years. I started out as a tax lawyer in a large downtown firm. I started my own practice in 1991. I currently confine my practice to prenuptial agreements and postnuptial agreements. &nbsp;I have a national practice in this field, performing mediation and consulting. &nbsp;I also represent clients as an attorney in Massachusetts prenups, as well as as a mediator.

","I believe in practicing mediation in the   shadow of the law  . This means that I will make sure mediation clients are informed as to what a legal court process or application of the law would suggest as an outcome, or a range of outcomes. This is because I believe the   law   is a distillation of equitable principles. Then people can make knowing and thoughtful choices and informed waivers. Another important quality of an effective mediator is responding truthfully to what is happening in the room. People trust you if they perceive that you're being truthful. That helps in the mediation process. Another area of my practice had been estate planning and probate of estates. I formerly practiced real estate law as part of my practice and started my law practice as a tax lawyer in a large downtown firm. This knowledge base and skill set works well with issues that come up in mediation.&lt;/p&gt;

Strive to build trust and maintain an environment conducive to constructive conversation and adapt my style to the needs of the situation utilizing a facilitative, directive or transformative approach. Unless agreed otherwise, we begin in joint session and proceed with caucus as necessary. In complex litigated cases, parties are asked to submit a brief mediation statement in advance. My practice encourages the parties to meet without attorneys if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;

James Lingl,lingladrs@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/James-Lingl,Mediator,Lingl A D R S,"James P. (Jim) Lingl has extensive legal experience both as a litigator and as transactional attorney. Between 1983 and 2008, he led a law firm that dealt primarily in Community Association law, a practice encompassing all aspects of homeowner association operation and management. During that time he was involved with the representation of over 600 homeowner associations between San Luis Obispo to San Diego Counties. He was also involved with the representation of more than 200 individual homeowners in disputes with their associations.
With a background in tort and commercial litigation, Mr. Lingl understands that courtrooms are appropriate venues for the resolution of some disputes. However his experience has taught him that less than 10% of the civil cases that are filed actually reach trial, and that most conflicts are better resolved outside of the judicial system. His extensive experience in handling complex interpersonal conflicts, whether arising in a homeowner association, in the probate context, among neighbors, or between businesses that can benefit from maintaining an ongoing relationship, all have helped to shape his   facilitative to evaluative   mediation style.
  
A graduate of the University of Wisconsin Law School, James P. Lingl was admitted to the Wisconsin Bar in 1975 and the California Bar in 1977. He received his initial mediation training in 1992 from the faculty of Pepperdine University Law School &amp;#8211; Straus Institute for Dispute Resolution in conjunction with the Ventura Center for Dispute Settlement. He has continued to pursue extensive specialized mediation training since that time. In July of 2005 he completed Ombudsman training through the International Ombudsman Association. In October of 2010 he completed his masters degree program in conflict resolution at California State University Dominguez Hills. Mr. Lingl serves as an adjunct professor at the Southern California Institute of Law, where he teaches an ADR course as well as a condominium law course.

In divorce cases, we initiate the court case, prepare financial disclosures, draft the formal Marital Settlement Agreement, and submit the final agreement to the court to complete the case. We enjoy working with clients who are open to brainstorming and collaborating to find alternative solutions and who come into mediation with an open mind and willingness to listen to the other party and accept guidance and coaching from the mediator to help navigate the process.
In premarital and postmarital agreement mediations, we enjoy brainstorming with the couple to help achieve financial and non-financial goals to support their relationship.

I may suggest a specific solution or give an assessment, so long as it doesn't impinge upon my duty to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

Kayre Chatellier,mediator@resolveitnow.us,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Kayre-Chatellier,Certified Mediator/Owner,Resolve It Now,"Kayre Chatellier is a Restorative Justice Advocate who is focused upon restorative processes which create greater pathways and opportunities toward strengthening communities through advocacy, connection, communication, and collaboration. Kayre received her Master's Degree in Criminal Justice at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina, an HBCU. She was working toward law school when she was exposed to an asset in the community, Cumberland County Dispute Resolution Center. Her exposure to mediation and the restorative practices employed through that Center changed her life and her journey. Kayre redirected her focus from Criminal Justice punitive practices toward restorative, resolution, and responsibility focuses in order to create community efficacy. The change from enforced &lsquo;locking them up and throwing away the key' to solutions and process that create community and community member strength is key in creating a stronger fabric of community which ties all people together in a more positive and responsible manner. Empowering people creates opportunities to empower and support businesses, services, nonprofits, families in our communities.
Kayre Chatellier is the Past President of the Montana Mediation Association and continues to be on the&nbsp; MtMA Board for several years. She has also served on the Board of the Billings Mediation Center for several years.&nbsp; She currently volunteers as a Certified Mediator and Mentor. As well, Kayre is a volunteer with Peace Hospice House for many years.&nbsp; And, has provided pro bono and sliding scale mediation opportunities to many members of her community, and abroad.
Mediation is an integral piece of the puzzle in providing opportunities toward stronger relationships through communication, problem-solving, empowerment, self-assessment, and healing in a safe, neutral, nonjudgmental, facilitative environment. Restorative Justice through mediation is just one piece of the puzzle. Restorative Justice is rife with ways in which to create community healing through communication, connectivity, collaboration, and resolution-based practices. Kayre believes that sharing ideas, philosophies, and experiences, especially if there is a vast difference in perspective, is a significant element in learning from each other to create positive and meaningful change.

I offer mediation, facilitation, conflict coaching, conflict analysis, and apology analysis.
My practice is based on the best practices in dispute resolution with a foundation rooted in a master's degree in dispute resolution, extensive training in specific techniques, and experience on what works.
COACHING: One to one help to improve personal conflict response.  
&amp;#8211;Individuals can gain understanding of their own conflict response and how to improve their conflict management skills.
MEDIATION: Facilitated negotiation where participants make the decisions.
&amp;#8211;Families stand to gain enormously by using mediation to resolve conflict rather than the courts. Mediation allows family members to make the decisions for loved ones' welfare, costs less, and takes less time. Mediation also may cause less harm to the relationship than litigation. I can help with your conservatorship, elder care, parenting plan, financial support, and property distribution.
&amp;#8211;Workplace Conflict can be mediated on site instead of a manager wasting their time on workplace conflict that saps productivity. Employees don't want to tell the manager what they are really feeling for fear of its effect on their position, but they will tell a neutral party who cannot affect their raise or promotion.

Mordechai Rhine,rmrhine@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Mordechai-Rhine,,,"Hi! My name is Mordechai Rhine. I grew up in Monsey, NY, a delightful suburban community in New York State. Like many of us, I took marriage for granted. We date, we marry, we have kids, and we parent them. So simple it seemed, until things don't go so simply.
I started my career as a community Rabbi and served in that capacity for over two decades. I got to see people in their personal struggles and triumphs, in adversity and in joy. On one particular occasion, when supporting a couple who was divorcing, I was introduced to the framework of mediation. I decided to find out more and discovered a style for conflict resolution that was grounded in principles that I had studied and taught all my life. Validating the past, yet focusing on the future, was a principle that I lived with. I had witnessed it as a truism to success in the people I had guided for many years. Shifting the focus from the initial ask, to uncover what people's interests really are, is a gift of personal discovery that a mediator assists with regularly when trying to discover common ground between the parties.
In 2016 I began training in the field of mediation and found the family focused training to be focused mostly on divorce. Indeed, seeking to achieve an amicable divorce is monumental. To work with couples who are separating after being so close and help them to reconfigure their relationships to successfully parent their children from separate homes, is a challenging but rewarding endeavor. When successful, the amicable divorce enables men, women, and children to move forward in life from a challenging situation, to a bright and supported future.
What interested me most though was a comment that a few mediators shared with me. They told me that a third of the couples that came to them for divorce, reconsidered after they were introduced to healthier communication styles. Many were able to reenter the marriage, engage each other and problem solve in healthier ways, and create a pleasant, if not truly blissful marriage as a result. I was truly intrigued by this and proceeded to expand my research and training to focus on in-marriage mediation.
Today, most of my clients are focused on saving their marriage, and I have adapted a number of key mediation principles to assist couples in understanding themselves and their spouses, in healing, and in building healthier marriages.
One of the great myths about professional mediation is that people think we just identify the area of disagreement and divide that in half. True mediation is far more profound and creative. When we practice mediation professionally, we look for interests and understanding such that we come to recognize how different issues are interrelated. We strive to discover how the topics, personalities, and situations fit together like puzzle pieces and we are able to produce solutions that are respected as win-win.
Mediation is a journey. As a profession it is an ever evolving and improving model to bring difficult relationship situations to resolution. It is also a personal journey for the participants. It is a process of discovering depth of feeling and of practical solutions that can work for you. For me as a mediator it is a journey of creativity to discover each person's needs and how the participants can be sensitive to each other and (re)build a loving life together or separately, if need be. Moments of admiration are frequent for me as I take note of the effort, progress, and clarity that each person achieves in the process.
The field of mediation charts a path between the legal realities that lawyers typically focus on, and the world of emotions that therapists typically focus on. I have found that by following this middle path that allows for critical thinking as well as deep emotions, very real and meaningful solutions emerge. True resolutions can be found even for fallout in the most treasured and close relationship of husband and wife. That in a nutshell is why I really value marriage mediation.

We also offer packages.  
Feel free to contact us for a free phone consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

",,"CARE Marriage Mediation Process&lt;/p&gt;
What to expect if you would like to work on your marriage and take it to a loving, nurturing place.&lt;/p&gt;
Caucus (30 minutes) &amp;#8211; I prefer to make separate appointments for husband and wife by phone or zoom to properly understand what issues you are dealing with. Sometimes it is more appropriate for me to proceed right away and meet jointly with husband and wife.&lt;/p&gt;
Joint sessions (90-120 minutes) &amp;#8211; Five steps to explore issues, develop effective tools, and share critical perspectives to help move your relationship to a loving and happy place.&lt;/p&gt;
Step 1- Each of you gets the opportunity to say your story.&lt;/p&gt;
Whether you are dealing with communication issues or relationship issues, this process can pave the way for healthy dialogue and a loving relationship. We work together to identify issues and proceed to address them with care and sensitivity. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is Richard Calson's &lt;em&gt;You Can Feel Good Again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Step 2- I invite each of you to present 3 things that you would like improved by your spouse, and 2 things that you feel you can work on to improve the marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
In session we explore why you feel these 5 items are important to your relationship and to your marriage. I advise people to start with one small step of improvement in each area. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is James Clear's &lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Step 3- What is Your Love Language?&lt;/p&gt;
Sometimes couples seem to be devoted to each other but feel terribly disconnected. In this step we explore what fills your love tank and what depletes it. You and your spouse will have an opportunity to understand your own love communications language, and what communications are valued by your spouse. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is Gary Chapman's &lt;em&gt;The Five Love Languages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Step 4- Learning the Art of Loving Conversations&lt;/p&gt;
When husbands and wives deal with difficult situations they will often slip into doses of contempt and defensiveness. Some simple changes in technique and presentation can help your spouse hear your concerns and enable you both to stay in problem solving mode, and on the same team. When you gain expertise in this area you will find that difficult conversations can actually be endearing (with a touch of humor) as you act as best friends. You both recognize that your love is greater than the issue at hand, and you can resolve issues together. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is John Gottman's &lt;em&gt;The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Step 5- The Path Forward&lt;/p&gt;
Conversations are the key to resolving issues and building a loving home. When you and your spouse develop the mutual ability to talk things through you have the keys to happiness and serenity. In this step we discuss what it takes to feel secure and safe in the relationship so that you can have open conversation with your spouse. You will learn the power of &ldquo;leaning in&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;leaning out&rdquo; when you have a concern in the relationship. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is &lt;em&gt;Crucial Conversations &lt;/em&gt;(Patterson, Greeny, McMillain, Switzler).&lt;/p&gt;
It is important to me that our sessions be as effective as possible. I encourage you to fill out authorizations to any therapists and mentors that you have, to be allowed to speak and collaborate with me. With your permission we can create a team to help you. I look forward to assisting you on your journey to a happy and nurturing marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

She is adept at helping the parties communicate constructively and preparing them to do so in advance of mediation. She believes the mediation process should provide parties information to help them analyze the likely outcome if they do not resolve their dispute and assist them to analyze whether the options immediately available in mediation are better for them than walking away without an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

I will do this with the assurance that I am there to keep things flowing in as positive a manner as is possible given the, often times, emotional undercurrents of the case.
  
I mediated neighborhood dispute resolution with the Community Boards Program of San Francisco, trained mediators, and then trained the trainers of mediators for many years.
I have maintained a private mediation practice since 1985 and I have taught Interpersonal, Organizational and Group Communication as well as Conflict Resolution and Mediation courses in the Communication Studies department at San Francisco State University since 1998.

That choice is left completely to the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
Since my background is in psychology I am capable of bringing the disputing parties to a point of understanding themselves and each other in a way that encourages a harmonious relationship throughout the mediation process, thereby, providing the parties with an environment conducive to bringing about a resolution that is considered fair, honest and beneficial to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever the term &ldquo;that is a deal killer&rdquo; is heard in a potential business sale and/or a real estate transaction (it could be a low appraisal problem, inspection report issues, lender unreasonableness, price and/or terms issues), someone should be suggesting that the parties retain the services of a knowledgeable real estate mediator. Often a solution can be found involving the financing, the future of one or more of the parties and other points.

He mediates as a team with an experienced lawyer-mediator mediator, TRICIA MARTLAND. While we have been practicing law&nbsp; for decades, when we mediate, we sit at the mediation table as mediators only. At the same time, our knowledge and our experience give us the ability to guide you to your best solution. We have found that   two heads are better than one   in the mediation process and our clients appreciate our different backgrounds and perspectives. We utilize Family Law Software to provide our clients with the best data to guide their decisions. We can mediate from our Newport office or via Zoom and elsewhere in Rhode Island by special arrangement.
  
I am a   family lawyer   in the broadest sense of the term. I have practiced since 1974, representing families, members of families (and others in a relationship) during good times and bad times. I have represented well over 2,000 divorce clients, both civilian and military, and more than that number of clients in other domestic matters including adoptive parents, juveniles, unmarried parents, grandparents, and other unmarried couples. I also have two associate attorneys who work for my law office in all areas of elder-law.

WHY DOES YOUR SALES AGREEMENT INCLUDE MEDIATION?
&lt;ul&gt;
 - MEDIATION IS CONSUMER FRIENDLY! 
 - Mediation is easier, faster and less expensive than litigation. 
 - Mediation is non-adversarial. 
 - A Mediator does not pass judgment. 
 - A Mediator serves to help the parties open communication, identify their differences and reach agreement on how to resolve their differences. 
 - A Mediator assists disputing parties in reaching a mutually acceptable solution to everyone's satisfaction. 
 - In mediation, when an agreement is reached, a written agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) is developed which outlines the terms of the settlement. 
 - If the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable settlement through mediation, they are free to arbitrate or litigate their dispute as if the mediation never took place.

Sharon believes that mediation can provides parties with a safe and productive process to resolve some of life's most challenging issues.

She charges for her time on an hourly basis. If the parties request, she can prepare legal paperwork for them at the conclusion of their mediation.

Since 2006, she has maintained her full time mediation practice as a solo practitioner and has served hundreds of parties, both represented by attorneys and self-represented. In mediation, Sharon's goal is to help parties resolve all aspects of family law matters including custody, support and property division issues in the context of divorce, paternity, domestic partnership and elder law matters.&lt;/p&gt;
","Sharon is acutely aware of the costs, both financial and emotional, that family disputes have on individuals and their families. She believes mediation can be a great benefit to individuals and families on both an emotional and a financial level. She strives to make all parties feel they have a safe and productive experience when they utilize her for mediation. Depending on the situation, parties either meet together in one room or sometimes a   caucusing   or shuttle method is used where Sharon moves between two rooms. Depending on the needs of the individuals and the issues involved, her approach is largely facilitative encouraging the parties to work the details of the resolution with her assistance. However, sometimes parties seek   evaluative   assistance, if they are not familiar with the various legal issues around their problems. She is a licensed attorney in Oregon, but as the mediator she cannot provide the parties with individual legal advice. However, she can provide them with legal education as to the laws and customs in Oregon and she will provide referrals for individual legal advice as parties desire to attorneys and qualified professionals such as CPA's as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
","Sharon received her Juris Doctor in 1985 from Willamette University College of Law and graduated from the Scholars Program at Portland State University in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science.

Patricia Barrett,pb@lifetimeplanning.cc,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Patricia-Barrett,Owner,Lifetime Planning LLC,"The goal of Lifetime Planning, LLC is to facilitate peaceful divorce settlements through the mediation of financial issues and the facilitation of a parenting plan. This is accomplished through customized financial tables enabling clients to see logical and equitable ways to divide assets before or after hiring an attorney. Services utilized before   lawyering up   will significantly lower cost. If we are hired after attorneys are retained, we can streamline the process and illustrate an equitable division of assets, adjusting for taxes and valuing pensions. Included in the financial road map is a 20-year cash flow spreadsheet which illustrates long-term effects of a settlement. Lifetime Planning has no product to sell; we do not manage money and are therefore completely objective with recommendations.
For Children's issues, she provides a fill-in-the blank parenting plan based on the Texas Family Code to allow the couple to establish their wishes and zero in on items needing mediation.
  
Patricia Barrett, with over twenty years experience in the financial services industry, began Lifetime Planning in 2004 in order to assist people facing divorce. Previously, she held series 7 (general securities), a series 63 license and was the manager of the Financial Planning Department for a prominent Houston Trust company.
Patricia is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Certified Divorce Financial Analyst (CDFA), and has completed Advanced Family Mediation Training through the University of Houston Law School. Patricia currently serves as the treasurer for the Association of Family Conciliation Courts and was a past treasurer of the Financial Planning Association of Houston.
Patricia attends continuing legal education symposiums several times each year in order to remain up-to-date on divorce rules in Texas. She teaches a recurring class to the public entitled &ldquo;Divorce in Texas &ndash; Money and More&rdquo; through Leisure Learning Unlimited.

This includes the on-site modification of computerized asset division and the illustration of long-term effects (20-year spreadsheet). Should the couple wish to forgo the long-term cash flow planning, the required hours are reduced substantially. Basic data entry and clerical duties are provided at $90 per hour for work not requiring Patricia's expertise. Lifetime Planning provides a check-list for the clients to choose their services, with the goal of providing the most cost effective, advantageous plan for the client.&lt;/p&gt;
","Since completing the A. A. White Mediation training at the University of Houston Law School, Patricia has facilitated more than 350 mediations, helping couples reach peaceable divorce settlements. Many of Patricia's mediation cases are referrals from attorneys that recognize her financial/mediation skills to help bring the couple to settlement. Satisfied clients refer friends and other budget minded clients choose Lifetime Planning services after researching available options.&lt;/p&gt;
","Patricia's approach to mediation involves separate meetings with each spouse to establish individual goals and interests. A questionnaire is provided to guide them in gathering financial documents and coming up with a budget. A spreadsheet is then created with percentages for each spouse, based on goals and the rules of equitable settlement. We often devise   what-if   scenarios to graphically illustrate a client's position post-divorce. We review each asset valuation and determine the proportion of separate and community property. Tax adjustments are calculated for assets such as capital gains, IRAs, 401ks, pensions, stock options, etc. so that each asset class is weighted on a more equal footing with the other assets. If alimony is possible and appropriate it can be offset with assets to give the paying spouse more of their pension (or other asset) and show the tax savings.&lt;/p&gt;
When emotions run high as they often do during a divorce, she encourages clients to consider this as a business transaction and to look toward their future, not the past. Patricia provides professional, personalized advice at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

","I believe that pre-mediation communications are important to determine and agree upon the best approach to increase the likelihood of a successful process. As a mediator, I play an active role in the process beyond the facilitation of communication between disputing parties. Throughout the mediation, I listen and strive understand each parties' perspective and objectives. I usually question each party and/or their counsel, reality test, help parties analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their cases, and offer ideas for resolution. My expectation is for the parties to participate with a good faith, sincere and serious intention to resolve the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

Jo Ann Myers,myersno@msn.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Jo-Ann-Myers,,Louisiana Mediators,"A divorce can be very costly and for that reason mediation is an  
alternative way to divorce and to work out coparenting details such as visitation schedules, child support, etc. Other issues, such as homes and financial affairs need to be settled. After deciding to divorce, a couple can sit down with us and negotiate and even though there might be some conflicts, mediation offers a less stressful and less costly way to divorce. The mediator is trained to help the couple through the negotiation process, and serves as a neutral, which means the mediator does not take anyone's side.
If a couple wishes to be represented, we offer as an alternative,  
collaborative-divorce which means one attorney represents the interests of both parties. The attorney and the mediator work with the couple to arrive at an agreement. If during the mediation or collaborative divorce one party cannot agree then an attorney can represent the interests of that party. However, this will make the process more expensive as the Courts will then get involved. Louisiana Mediation strives to structure the divorce process to meet needs of our clients.
An initial consultation of one hour is $75.00 and at that time we can  
explore options. It is better if both parties attend, but if one party is reluctant, the other party can come in alone.
If you decide you just want to file for divorce, Louisiana Mediation has an attorney who can file your papers and represent you in a simple divorce for $900.00 plus court filing fees.
Payment plans can be discussed. We accept credit cards.

Second, I am certified to administer the Conflict Dynamics Inventory to assist workplace team building, executive coaching and counseling. Third, I have provided mediation and negotiation training including a basic 40 hour mediation and numerous advanced trainings made to order for the client. Fourth, I am developing a nationwide roster of people trained to administer  
a psychometric test which I developed,   Trans-acting in the Workplace  .
In the next half year I will be offering 3 training webinars: Bowen's concept of Differentiation (3 hours) , A Family Mediation Tool; Administering, Scoring, Couching and Counseling using the results of Trans-acting in the Workplace (6 hours); Basic Family Mediation Training (40 hours).
  
Extensive years of training experience. Have received training to administer the Conflict Dynamics Inventory. Will present workshops on the use of the Trans-acting in the Workplace assessment too.
I am offering the opportunity for interested dispute resolvers to participate in a training as to the use of Trans-acting in the Workplace. This psychometric tool assesses communication in the workplace and provides insight into how all parties who work together manage to maintain their roles vis-a-vis others in the workplace. The main goal of the test is to address the dysfunctional interaction. When we think of the day-to-day interaction among those in the workplace, particularly when we are asked to help parties resolve their differences, we bring any number of theories and techniques to bear. Over the years, certain concepts come to the fore and are repeatedly used by individual dispute resolvers not only to assess the conflict but also to provide counseling and recommendations for amelioration.
Test takers are asked to rank their behavior resulting in scores that are used by the test administrator to create profiles either of the individual or of the group. These profiles, in turn, are used to provide counseling and recommendations for future behavior. A high score in a profile represents a strength and a low score represents a weakness.

Charles Castagna,cnc@castagnamediation.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Charles-Castagna,,Castagna Mediation,"In Florida, party self-determination is a primary directive. With that in mind, my approach to mediation is to give the parties to a dispute every opportunity to meet together, if appropriate, and consider all perspectives to their dispute: what they think they want and need, and what they really want and need in order to resolve the dispute. I strongly encourage them to consider all dimensions to the dispute, including strengths and weaknesses in their position as well as those of the other party. In addition, I urge consideration of what result might arise from an adversarial determination as well as the economic and emotional costs of getting to that point.

Rabbi Shoshana Susan Dworsky,shoshdworsky@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Rabbi-Shoshana-Susan-Dworsky,,Dworsky Mediation,"Welcome to Dworsky Mediation!
Shosh Dworsky is an ordained rabbi, and offers mediation to clients from diverse backgrounds and walks of life, of any and all faiths or of no faith at all. She works with couples (including same-sex), family members, professional associates or friends, and can serve as a parenting consultant or expediter.
Shosh provides a safe, neutral space in which to explore a conflict and resolve it. As mediator she acts as neither advocate nor judge, allowing the parties to set their own agenda, providing the kind of time for conversation that clients are unlikely to find in a courtroom or law office. Clients will find her to be respectful, fair, attentive, accepting, non-judgmental and broad-minded. The title &lsquo;rabbi' indicates not that she is driven by doctrine, but that she is an experienced, thoughtful and caring person committed to helping people navigate pain and conflict and live with dignity.
  
Shosh Dworsky's training in counseling and communication over the past twenty-five years has given her skills which she employs as mediator, counselor, educator, and chaplain. She received rabbinical ordination in 1998 (Jewish Theological Seminary of America) and worked with congregations in New York City and Portland, Oregon before returning to her native St. Paul and joining the staff at Carleton and St.Olaf Colleges as Associate Chaplain for Interfaith Life.
Shosh has been on the roster of Qualified Neutrals under Rule 114 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice since 2007. She is a regular volunteer mediator for the Dispute Resolution Center, Ramsey County, and currently sits on their Board of Directos. She has mediated countless cases in Housing and Conciliation Courts. In private practice she sees couples and families, as well as workplace colleagues, neighbors or friends who are finding conversation about a conflict challenging, and could use some support.

I charge only for time spent with clients.&lt;/p&gt;
","In her private practice, Rabbi Dworsky sees clients who are working on relationships and communication, including family and parenting issues such as commitment, divorce, parenting styles and schedules, financial issues, spousal support or division of assets, and extended and blended family relations. Additionally she has volunteered with the Minneapolis Police Civilian Review Authority, with the Dispute Resolution Center (DRC) in Ramsey County Housing and Conciliation Courts, and with Ramsey County Volunteer Divorce Mediation  
Program.&lt;/p&gt;
","In her words:  
&ldquo;Mediation as I practice it is an approach to dispute resolution that brings parties together for conversation and affords them the opportunity to determine for themselves how best to deal with the issues they bring to this conversation. The role of mediator as I see it is not to give advice, but to remain neutral and non-judgmental while helping to ensure that each person's thoughts, ideas, feelings or needs get expressed. Solutions people arrive at through the mediation process may include decisions to seek legal, financial, therapeutic, or other kinds of assistance outside of our mediation. In mediation they have the opportunity to talk, listen, and think in a safe setting as they work to discern what they themselves need.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Emmett Aldrich,emmett.aldrich@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Emmett-Aldrich,,Christian Mediation Services,"Conflict in Churches or other religious institutions is inevitable. After all, religious organizations are made up of human beings who bring their emotions and personalities with them to Sunday services, choir practice, board meetings and other Church activities.
Consequently, we should not be surprised that conflicts can easily arise between Churches, within Churches, between church groups, or among its individual members.
There are many sources of conflict within the Church, such as differences in beliefs, values, opinions or simple misunderstandings. Perceptions of unfair treatment or problems in communicating can lead to disagreements or disputes. When an argument or disagreement arises between members of the Congregation, everyone feels the negative effects of the dispute, and the resulting tension serves as a distraction from the worship service and the positive aspects of a Christ centered organization.
With this as the challenge, CMS is dedicated to helping Churches or other religious institutions find a Christian response to conflict resolution. These services are offered in a number of different ways. Whether it is mediation of inter or intra Church disputes, disagreements among members, or internal family conflicts with parishioners, we are all called by God to resolve conflicts in a peaceful and Christian way.
Christian Mediation Services is proud to now offer Elder Care Mediation services.
  
BS degree with double major in Psychology and Sociology from Geo Wash Univ. MS degree in Labor Studies from Univ of DC. Over 100 hours training in mediation and conflict resolution. Can also conduct training and counseling in conflict resolution.

We use a client-centered, positive psychology approach.
Affordable Mediation focuses on helping individuals and couples find the best path and the healthiest way to move forward through divorce by providing a compassionate, supportive, non-judgmental environment to be heard and explore options. Modern Mediation is for couples who have a more sophisticated financial situation.&nbsp; You will have a collaborative mediation team, including a certified divorce financial analyst, a QDRO and retirement professional, and a divorce/co-parenting Coach.&nbsp; Attorneys are included, as needed. We can help with every aspect of the divorce process including preparing and filing your initial court documents, helping you reach agreements on division of property, spousal maintenance, child support, parenting time and custody (legal decision-making) and drafting your property settlement agreement, parenting plan and divorce decree.
We believe providing a skilled professional team and supportive environment is the key to helping couples see their way to workable solutions.

I have over 35 years' experience as an attorney, and over 20 years' experience as a Family Law Mediator. I conduct private mediation sessions for parties before litigation has commenced, and I have been appointed by the Circuit Court for Carroll County, Maryland, to serve as a Court Appointed Mediator. I regularly attend continuing education in the legal and mediation fields. In addition to my practice as both a private and Court appointed mediator, I practice law in the areas of Family Law, Estate Planning, and Estate Administration.
  
Since earning my Juris Doctor degree in 1984, I have continued to attend continuing legal education. I am a trained mediator in the areas of Family Law, including child custody issues, child access, child support,and all monetary issues in a divorce including property distribution, the division of pensions, and alimony. I am also a trained mediator in the fields of estate law and guardianship law.

If an agreement is reached, the fee for the preparation of a complete Marital Settlement agreement is generally $1000.00, with that fee also usually split between the parties. For unmarried parties where there are no property issues, a lesser fee may be charged for the parenting agreement, which varies based upon the complexity of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
As the Agreements I prepare need to be notarized, many parties also return to my office to execute the final Agreement in the presence of one of the notaries at my office.&nbsp; There is no additional charge for this service.&lt;/p&gt;
","I have been a practicing mediator of over 20 years and currently conduct approximately 100 mediation sessions per year. I conduct private mediation sessions for people who attend mediation before commencing litigation, as well as mediation sessions for people referred to me by the Court after suit has been filed, but before the case is litigated. I have dealt with all issues related to child custody, child access, and child support for unmarried parents, and these same issues and all other issues that arise out of a marriage for married couples, including all financial issues, such as retirement accounts, pension division, and spousal support.&lt;/p&gt;
","I utilize a facilitative approach to mediation, where I assist the parties in coming to their own agreement. I believe that it is the parents who know what best serves the interests of their children and themselves. In addition to formulating a parenting plan, I will assist married couples with the equitable distribution of any marital assets.  
I firmly believe that, in almost all instances, an amicable agreement reached by the parties through mediation, is preferable to a judicial resolution. Parents of children will need to interact with one another for the rest of their lives, and to be able to do so amicably, will make it easier for them and for their children.&lt;/p&gt;
","I received my Bachelor's Degree in 1981 from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, double majoring in Economics and Political Science. I then attended The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C., graduating with my Juris Doctor degree in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

","&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Based on thousands of cases mediated and observed, I can say there are &ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;3 Universal Factors of Success&lt;/strong&gt;&rdquo; in mediation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - Timing: Do the parties have enough information to make decisions? Mediation can facilitate the exchange information and make decisions in discovery disputes like an arbitrator or special master.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Communication: Are the participants able to convey their perspectives and understand what the other side is saying? Cases can (and do) settle even though the parties do not agree on what happened, or what the law provides, or what will happen in the future (i.e., in court).&lt;/li&gt;
 - Strategy: Do the parties and counsel have a strategy for the mediation? How will they respond to narratives that they find objectionable, litigation threats, and monetary offers or demands that are &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; or &ldquo;pie in the sky?&rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Responding&lt;/em&gt; to these challenges is very different than &lt;em&gt;reacting&lt;/em&gt; to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I believe a difficult conversation needs to happen, I will structure it in a clear and safe manner so that it addresses the issues contributing to impasse. This has helped parties resolve highly competitive, &ldquo;money-driven&rdquo; disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

Brian is the proud father of a gay son, and a seven-year Vietnam-era veteran of the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
","Brian's primary focus is in getting past the placing of blame so that both parties can concentrate on creating a solution. This often involves getting the parties to truly &lt;i&gt;listen&lt;/i&gt; to each other, then trying to get them to &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; each others' true interests. Brian is very skilled at knowing when things are being withheld and when miscommunication has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
From a process standpoint, he will get all issues on the table, and then will subdivide big problems into smaller, easier-to-solve ones. Brian's engineering background is well balanced by his empathy and people skills, so results and feelings are both considered.&lt;/p&gt;
As a non-attorney mediator, Brian works in synergy with the parties' attorneys. He is skilled in recognizing when questions or issues require an attorney's involvement, and is careful to refer the parties to their respective attorneys for personalized advice and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Since I founded Aging in Harmony in 2007, I have supported older adults and their families and caregivers who are struggling with conflicts about the future of their aging loved ones' care and estate. No matter whether you are just starting to discuss later life plans or are already facing end of life challenges, my mediation services can help you understand each other's views and reach agreements that meet the needs of everyone involved &ndash; in person, by phone or online via Zoom.
During 30+ years as a facilitator, I have guided large community-based organizations through highly emotional meetings and supported families facing challenging decisions associated with the aging process. I'm also an experienced trainer and coach for classes and workshops teaching skills in intercultural and/or nonviolent communication, conflict management, and mediating with older adults.
In addition to my specialty of Elder Mediation, I have led numerous Community Mediations, as well as court-based Guardianship and Civil Harassment mediations. I also serve on the Civil Court Mediation Panel of the Superior Court of Alameda County.
I am a member of the American Society on Aging (ASA) and the Association for Conflict Resolution (ACR), where I have served as Finance Chair of the Elder Mediation Section.

My professional experience before becoming a mediator includes Retail Management, Journalism/PR and Administration of Cross-Cultural Educational Programs (listed in chronological order).

Gesher employs a generally facilitative mediation style, allowing the parties to drive the process. However, she is skilled at highlighting potential legal strengths for parties and may occasionally use evaluative skills if the mediation requires it. Clients have cited her as an insightful, fair, and impartial mediator who had a unique ability to really listen to their issues and make them feel comfortable throughout the mediation process.
Gesher has mediated many cases that concluded with a successful settlement agreement. She is available for cases that have already been filed, as well as for those that have not yet reached the litigation stage. Gesher's areas of experience include family law, landlord/tenant disputes, intellectual property disagreements, and corporate/business disputes, business partnerships cases, and non-profit conflicts.
  
Nicole Gesher was raised in San Diego, CA, the daughter of South African immigrants. She attended the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where she graduated with High Honors in English and History. Ms. Gesher also studied abroad at Oxford University in 2002. She lived and worked abroad in Montevideo, Uruguay for one year before attending UC Hastings College of the Law, where she participated in the Mediation Clinic.

","Ms. Gesher's practice focuses mainly on facilitative mediation. This means that unless specifically requested, she will refrain from offering her legal opinion on the matter at hand. Instead, she will facilitate a conversation between the two parties, serving as a third-party neutral mediator. In practice, Ms. Gesher believes this to be a highly effective method of dispute resolution, because the parties themselves drive the process. This is important because after the mediation, it is the parties who have consented to abide by the agreement.

Gail has confidence that conflict can be seen as an opportunity for personal transformation and encourages each party to determine areas of acceptance, compromise and accountability as well as to affirm their own voices and both listen to and hear that of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

Having spent 10 years as a trial attorney and far more time in a business setting I truly understand why most disputes should be settled and not litigated. That is why I completed a Masters in Psychology which I will combine with my legal and business experience to become the best mediator I can possibly become. I have started this on a part-time basis which will be expanded when I retire from the Insurance Industry in October. Hopefully, I'll be able to continue helping solve problems until I make that final journey decades in the future.

Dennis Cohen,Dac@settlementworks.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Dennis-Cohen,Attorney/Mediator,Settlement Works,"Going through a divorce can cause many emotions to surface: anger, hurt, fear, loss and confusion. Searching for the best way to defend your legal rights as well as manage your costs can be emotionally draining. You are not only in a time of transition, but you are also headed into a season of transformation.
The approach you and your spouse take toward this process and the professionals you choose to support you will make the difference between a stressful, financially and emotionally draining experience and one that brings you relief and resolution. No one can promise a painless process, but at least the challenges can be minimized.
At Settlement Works, our commitment is to assist the resolution of everything from simple disagreements to complex, emotionally charged, high asset disputes. In every case, we believe there is an opportunity to heal and complete the existing relationship and open the door for a new relationship &amp;#8211; as effective co-parents and/or possibly respected friends.
Additionally, couples who are already divorced often have ongoing issues that need resolution. Changes in support, custody, visitation and lifestyle differences can create serious challenges which call for a resolution outside of the typical litigation setting.
With regard to civil litigation, mediation offers an effective and economical mechanism to resolve everything from a discovery dispute to the entire lawsuit. As with family law cases, many civil lawsuits have an emotional context that can be addressed and beneficially resolved for all concerned.
  
I have been practicing law in California since 1975. My primary focus has always been Family Law, but I've also spent considerable with civil litigation matters. Although I've always had a settlement approach to the practice of law, I began actively mediating in 1999.  
I have been on the Los Angeles Superior Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Panel since 2000.

Our standard mediation fee for the services of an attorney/mediator is $400 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
For two attorney/mediators in a session, the fee is $700 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
If the services of a Marriage and Family Services are requested, the fee for that professional is $175 per hour. If combined with an attorney/mediator in joint session, the fee is $500 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
","Although it seems like I've been mediating disputes since I was five years old, the inspiration for the Settlement Works mediation program came only after a 25 year career in civil litigation and family law, as well as many additional years of self-realization and transformational work.&lt;/p&gt;
In my work with the Center for Enforcement of Family Support, a law practice dedicated to helping custodial parents collect their past due support, I saw the anger many divorced couples still carried, even many years after their divorce was final. I saw that this anger pre-empted and frustrated the resolution of legal issues, resulting in exorbitant legal fees and leading to residual emotional damage, especially to children caught in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
In 1999, I founded Settlement Works and began to explore a new approach to legal conflicts. Using traditional mediation as a cornerstone, this evolving approach offers an efficient resolution of legal disputes while addressing and healing the unresolved emotional issues of divorce and other types of family and civil conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
Using this approach I have mediated hundreds of Family Law and Civil Litigation matters.&lt;/p&gt;
","I look at mediation as an opportunity to engage in an informative exchange of ideas and opinions, while helping litigants resolve their differences with an economically and emotionally beneficial outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
While successful mediation often entails several styles of dispute resolution, the most important element is safety. My goal is to empower the clients to appropriately express their wants and needs, while they develop and practice listening with a reasonable level of receptivity. I believe clients should be given a basic understanding of the laws at issue, so they can make informed decisions. I usually share my analysis and viewpoint freely with both parties, helping them see the strengths and weaknesses of their case.&lt;/p&gt;
Although mediation can be very serious and have a significant impact on a party, I find it helpful to create a relaxed atmosphere with as much lightness as is appropriate and possible. At Settlement Works, we are fortunate to have our mediation on a classic Chris Craft motor yacht (  Concordance  ) in Marina del Rey. Our clients tell us that the relaxing environment greatly reduces the stress of the meeting process. Personally, I find that communication flows more freely &ldquo;on the water.&rdquo; More often than not a client's wistful comment on the beautiful life going on outside, is all it takes to get the parties thinking that it really is time to work things out.&lt;/p&gt;
","I am a graduate of UCLA School of Law and hold a B.A. in Psychology from Arizona State University. I received specialty training from Mosten Mediation Training Center, the Los Angeles County Bar Association Dispute Resolutions Services, and the Strauss institute for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes the person is able to rebuild a damaged relationship and other times they may choose to move on and rebuild their lives differently.
The stress you normally experience when you sit with unresolved conflicts and negative feelings about others shifts significantly when you confront those conflicts and make choices on how to change things.&nbsp; The old saying of &amp;#8216;a weight off my shoulders' applies here.
I work primarily as a coach, a mediator and as a consultant in conflict management. Related work includes leadership coaching or mentoring; leadership development workshops;as well as workplace investigations and consulting on employee engagement particularly in activating engagement via&nbsp; the strategic and operational planning (everybody has to have a purpose, otherwise, why are they on payroll?).
I work with teams and leaders in the corporate environment (public and private) as well as with small enterprises, community organizations and families.
Whatever support you need from me in overcoming or resolving conflict, I'll offer you a process that works for YOU.

If mediation is in a workplace context I enter into an agreement with the employer whereby payment will then be their responsibility, and I then require the parties to dispute to sign an Agreement to Mediate.&lt;/p&gt;
For coaching and consulting we also work off a base rate, coupled by ability to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
","I first started professionally working as a mediator after I completed my training at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada, 13years ago, and as a conflict coach after my training with Cinnie Noble, about 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
My ADR experience goes back decades, first when I was a trade unionist in Nova Scotia, where we regularly had to rely on mediators to assist labour and management to avoid industrial action and resolve contentious issues in collective bargaining and other workplace disputes, and subsequently in South Africa, during the height of the transition from apartheid to democracy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I therefore witnessed a range of mediators working with very different disputants under diverse circumstances and learned a great deal.&nbsp; In my own experience in mediating both workplace and family disputes, I continue building my understanding of conflict dynamics and ways of breaking impasses and creating unexpected positive solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
","Influenced by my background in conflict coaching I prefer to get to know each of the disputants first: their understanding of the conflict as seen through the lens of their own experience, values, needs, mandates, etc., and how they understand the other party's context and priorities.&nbsp; These are highly confidential conversations. They serve to give me information and insights and they also serve to establish trust between us (it is as important for the mediator to trust the client as vice versa).&nbsp; I do not invite the parties into the same conversation until I am satisfied that they are able to shift from their original positions in a way that takes the conversation forward in a construtive manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the mediation results in consensus, or agreement on some points and not others, I write up the agreement and give both parties the opportunity to review, clarify and refine it.&nbsp; &nbsp;In a family law situation, where the clients would rely on the agreement in court proceedings, I advise them to have the agreement scrutnitized by their respective lawyers, before signing.&lt;/p&gt;
At times when agreement cannot be reached, I would continue working with a disputant, providing conflict coaching, which enables them to work out a way of moving forward despite that no agreement had been reached. a&lt;/p&gt;
A standard feature of my mediation service it that I remain accessible to all parties for a period up to three months after the signing of a mediated agreement, in the event that some difficulty arises regarding the interpretation or application of the agreement. At times I would continue to facilitate a parental discussion around the managing/implementation of a parenting plan.&lt;/p&gt;

Chris has worked exclusively in the area family law for almost twenty years. Following his time in the family law litigation world Chris realized that for the vast majority of family law cases, a courtroom is an inappropriate place for spouses and parents to resolve differences about their family, finances and future direction. As a result, Chris turned his full time attention to a family law mediation practice.
Since 2003, Chris has worked full time as a professional mediator handing many complex and high asset divorces as well as couples in high conflict. While many people may call themselves a &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; and describe their &ldquo;years of experience&rdquo;, it is the sheer volume of cases and great variety of clients that distinguishes Chris' work from other mediators.
Split Simple provides clients with access to knowledge and technology that facilitates their resolution in an intelligent and efficient manner. Moreover the Split Simple fixed pricing plan allows couples to know their costs going into mediation rather than having to guess at a range of potential costs.

For couples that want a prenuptial agreement or decide that they wish to separate or divorce, if both parties are willing, mediation is a sensible alternative. The mediation process is a non-adversarial method to come to an agreement facilitated by a trained mediator. Couples can avoid the high conflict that often accompanies litigation by using mediation.
In most cases a mediated matter will be resolved quicker and cost substantially less than litigation. The process involves meeting with your spouse and the mediator to discuss and resolve the issues that need to be settled and part of an agreement to be used to make a binding agreement, legal separation or divorce. A mediator is a neutral third party that does not represent either side in the process but rather is there to aid in the putting together of the agreement. Compliance with mediated settlements is high since the parties craft an agreement that makes sense for them, their children, and their specific family circumstances.
Darren M. Shapiro is an experienced matrimonial and family law attorney that completed mediation training with the Center for Mediation and Training in New York City. Call to schedule a half hour free, in office, consultation for the couple contemplating mediation.
  
Since the firm's inception, Darren M. Shapiro, Esq. has been focusing on matrimonial and family law. His background in civil litigation and criminal defense have proven very useful in providing effective representation.

In addition, we can serve as both a coach and advisor through the process. We can help you evaluate your spouse's information, and initiate and evaluate settlement proposals. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of our client's position, and various proposals while being sensitive to the importance of our role in the process. We assist by attending mediation sessions and participating directly in the mediation, especially with respect to complex financial issues.&lt;/p&gt;
","We recommend initial mediation to most of our clients as a means to resolve family law disputes effectively in a cost efficient manner. Mediation allows spouses to face each other in a non-confrontational setting to address their differences and to determine their future course of action without the mandate of a court or the cost of litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
Research indicates that mediation is successful in more than one-half of the cases and that parties with mediated outcomes are less likely to have post-agreement disputes. With the enactment of Title 17 of the Maryland Rules relating to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), there are even more opportunities for mediated resolution of the complex financial aspects arising out of a divorce. Mediation allows both parties to become educated about the realities of litigation in an informal process, without the harsh reality of a court order. The rules of evidence do not apply and witnesses are not called. Mediation may take one or several sessions. The goal remains mutually agreeable resolution and the mediator's suggestions may provide substantial guidance. Subject to certain delineated exceptions, mediation is confidential, and &ldquo;&amp;#8230;a mediator and any person present or otherwise participating in the mediation at the request of the mediator shall maintain the confidentiality of all mediation communications and may not disclose or be compelled to disclose mediation communications in any judicial, administrative, or other proceeding.&ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Kim Whelan,kim@kimwhelanmediation.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Kim-Whelan,,Kim Whelan Mediation,"I began focusing on divorce mediation after watching friends and family members navigate the often painful process of divorce, and witnessing the benefits of mediation. As the divorced mother of two sons myself, I also appreciate the importance of being able to successfully co-parent with your ex-spouse after divorce and I believe the mediation process is more conducive to that goal.
I am invested in helping people get divorced without letting fear and anger drive the process, so that decisions are made from a rational and grounded place. The ideal client for me is a couple who wants to look back on their divorce process and know that they handled things with dignity, and made choices from their best selves. I will bring compassion, structure, and expertise &mdash; and will ensure that you address every issue (legal and financial) necessary to file for divorce. As your mediator, my goal is to drive the process, not the outcome.

My background is a little unusual for what I do. I have a business background and an MBA from Harvard. I believe that my varied business experience has actually been very helpful to my divorce mediation practice. First, I am comfortable with the numbers. And increasingly, divorce is a lot about dealing with money issues. I am not intimidated by complicated family finances, and can be helpful when one or both parties need to be well informed about their financial options. In addition, much of my work as a consultant dealt with helping clients to identify their interests and needs and to explore options for solving their problems.

DeLila Bergan,dbergan@aimmediation.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/DeLila-Bergan,,,"Aging isn't always simple. Even the closest of families may find themselves at odds over critical aging-related choices. Older adults and their family members may disagree about: 1) plans for care; 2) whether it is time for an older adult to move from the family home and, if so, to where; 3) whether the older adult is a safe driver; 4) plans for financing long-term care; 5) the fair division of opportunities for family members to provide assistance; 6) whether a guardian/conservator is needed and, if so, who should serve; 7) how best to meet the needs of an adult with disabilities; and 8) distribution of estate assets after a death. Families and senior care professionals may disagree over the quality of services provided or the billing for those services. Residents in senior housing may have conflicts with management or other residents.
At AIM Aging Issues Mediation, we help families stop fighting. Our eldercare mediators serve as neutral facilitators to help parties talk with each other, listen to each other and move forward in a respectful fashion to find mutually acceptable solutions to their conflicts. We help parties build consensus, share ownership of their problems and develop realistic solutions to meet the challenges facing older, ill or disabled adults today.
We welcome calls directly from older adults or family members who want to decrease family tensions, as well as from the courts, attorneys, doctors, care facilities and other senior care professionals who want to help families resolve conflicts and preserve vital family relationships.
  
DeLila Bergan practiced as an elder law attorney for many years before transitioning to eldercare mediation. She worked with clients who were preparing wills, trust, or powers of attorney and with those applying for governmental benefits (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, VA. She assisted families struggling with dementia and guided them through the guardianship/conservatorship process. As a court-appointed guardian and conservator, she protected the rights of elderly clients and assisted them with both care and financial decisions. She worked with clients who had lost a loved one to probate estates and transfer assets. She worked with clients and Adult Protective Services to protect vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Those experiences deepened her understanding of the issues facing aging, ill and disabled adults and family caregivers.
Ms. Bergan is also a bioethicist with a special focus on aging and end-of-life issues. This training in medical ethics and patient rights complements her legal background.
Individual and family-decision making for aging individuals is a complex mix of practical day-to-day concerns, financial quandaries, questions of physical and cognitive capacities and decisions for long-term and end-of-life care, all of which center on the needs of the individual at the heart of the controversy. Ms. Bergan's legal and bioethical training and experience make her uniquely qualified as a mediator to assist older adults and family members in working together on a wide range of challenges.

Some mediations involve several issues and many parties, while others are less complex. Once we start our intake and identify the primary issues and parties involved, we will quote a flat fee for our services. Whenever possible, we encourage parties to share payment of our fees so that everyone is invested when sessions begin.&lt;/p&gt;
For ongoing facilitation/mediation services for senior care professionals, we can charge either a per-session fee or work from a monthly-averaged fee.&lt;/p&gt;
For court-ordered mediations, the judge may specify an hourly or flat fee.&lt;/p&gt;
","AIM Aging Issues Mediation focuses on adult family and eldercare facilitation/mediation.&lt;/p&gt;
","At AIM Aging Issues Mediation, we begin through an intake process in which we talk with potential parties to the mediation in advance of any mediation sessions. The intake conversations are designed to help parties understand the mediation process and to help us identify both issues of concern and the persons needed to participate in order to resolve existing questions and disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;
We next encourage all parties to meet together for an initial group session to improve communication, lessen tensions and identify primary issues for discussion. When it is helpful, we provide education on aging issues and we refer families to appropriate senior care professionals for expert assistance. We then follow up to facilitate communication among the parties as they explore resources and potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
We again encourage all parties to meet together for discussion when it seems they have enough information to form a plan to meet the needs of the individual(s) at the heart of the controversy. We help the parties define and state their plan in writing and ask each to sign off on the plan as a pledge of their support going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
Throughout the process, we help those involved express themselves to other family members and, in turn, listen to others.

","Mediation requires a combination of patience, creativity, perseverance and empathy. My role, as mediator, is to allow the parties a safe place to share their experience, explore the strengths and weaknesses of their case, and seek out a path to resolution. Each mediation is unique and preparation is essential. Pre-mediation statements and conferences are an important part of the mediation process. Prior to the date of mediation, I typically invite input from the parties regarding process (including use of joint sessions or opening statements), available pathways to resolution, and perceived obstacles to resolution. I adapt my style to address the needs of the parties. Depending on the party and the circumstances, my role may be to listen, to question, to analyze, or to push. Often needs evolve during the mediation, which requires perception, flexibility, and willingness to adapt to the needs of each dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

James Mathie,jmathie@mathiemediation.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/James-Mathie,,Mathie Mediation Services LLC,"Hi, this is Jim Mathie. Thanks for taking the time to consider me to assist you in resolving your dispute.
Mediation offers advantages that you can't get in litigation. Significantly, you get to determine whether to resolve your dispute and how to do it. That won't happen in court. Someone will win and someone will lose. Sometimes both sides actually lose. In mediation the win&ndash;win, is not a myth, it can really happen.
My goal is to assist the parties to understand each other's perspective. Understanding does not mean agreeing, but through understanding the parties can often see past the blinders that litigation imposes and mine the creativity necessary to find a mutually beneficial resolution.
Whenever possible, I use mediation through understanding. Instead of working separately against each other, the parties work together &ndash; often in the same room &ndash; to understand each other and resolve their differences.
We don't ignore the legal aspects of the dispute, but we put it in the proper perspective, looking at strengths, but also recognizing risks and practical realities.
This isn't easy. There is tension in any conflict. But parties who have the courage to address their differences and are open-minded enough to know that there are always two sides, can transcend their conflict and gain true resolution and in so doing preserve past, present or future relationships that are too important to destroy by litigation.
There's more to it than that, but I'm only allowed 1600 characters here, so please give me a call and we'll talk. Thanks again.

Litigation destroys relationships, while mediation helps you maintain your relationship and get to the heart of the issues that are causing conflict in your relationship.
If you're getting married we can assist you with pre-marital mediation and prenuptial agreements to ensure you and your soon to be spouse have all of those important conversations that are necessary before you get married. If you're married and having problems then we can use mediation tools to help you and your spouse stay together and find arrangements that alleviate the issues. If you're getting divorced, then our mediators help you stay out of court and allow you to remain in control of your future. We can help you save time, money and reduce your stress during a difficult time.
Our mediators will ensure that all of your issues are discussed, help you come to agreements and then make sure that everything is drafted and filed correctly with the court. If you're already divorced and having problems co-parenting then the mediations can work with you to modify your parenting plans, support or other orders. Additionally, we also assist our families with financial planning at all stages of their lives and ensure that your finances are in order so this does not cause any additional stress on you.

I can help people view things beyond what they are experiencing now, which can feel like a quantum leap once on the other side of them. The secret is to meet these challenges in the best way possible. I draw upon my life experiences, training, and Ho'oponopono to be a neutral and empathic listener in group meetings, mediations and negotiations.
As a Certified Mediator, Certified Divorce Financial Analyst&reg; Practitioner, Relationship Advisor, and Coach, I help move clients into their futures by helping with a decision, making and finding additional resources that can benefit them along the way. As a Neutral Financial Professional, I collaborate with Attorneys for parties using Collaborative Law to resolve disputes. I help clients clarify complex financial problems and project various financial outcomes into the future to help with decision making in dividing assets. I am also active in mediating Sexual Harassment and other types of employment cases.
I care deeply about empowering my clients to work together to move beyond conflict and bring things back into balance. I support them in clarifying complex and difficult problems and help them find resolution in a life-enhancing way.

"Wayne Holcomb, MBA, JD",info@attorneyholcomb.com,"https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Wayne-Holcomb,-MBA,-JD",,Holcomb Law,"I am an Attorney Mediator, and that combination offers a client more options and enhanced advice. Even as an Attorney, I fully believe that an attempt at a mediation process often makes litigation completely unnecessary. It is also usually much less expensive and provides for much more control of the outcome. Why should we give someone in a black dress (Judge), who does not know us at all, and has only a few minutes to listen to us, the power to ORDER us to a particular resolution of OUR case&hellip;? The common theme with Court-Ordered resolutions is that they are decided fairly quickly in Court&ndash;and NO ONE leaves happy&ndash;usually not even the lawyers.
We have witnessed disputes, that had persisted for years, even between long-term friends or family members, that resisted even the &ldquo;genius&rdquo; of Attorneys and the Court-system, resolved in literally only hours. We have seen these individuals enter the mediation room as &ldquo;disputants,&rdquo; unable to talk to each other, or even look at each other, and then after Mediation, leave as friends again.
These results cannot be guaranteed for every Mediation case, but the odds are probably in your favor&amp;#8230;
Divorces or business, personal, or neighborhood disputes should not be hammered to Court, forced to litigation like a broken record . . . as if there were no other option. Alternative solutions, like Mediation or Arbitration, always make better financial sense&ndash;and almost always produce better, less expensive, longer-lasting results. Isn't this what we all want?
  
I am a second-career attorney. My first job after college was to fly aircraft off of U.S. Navy ships for twenty years. I flew E-2's and retired in Norfolk, Virginia in 2006. I began mediating family and business disputes after earning my certifications in Virginia in 2004.

I have also been qualified as a Mediator Mentor in Virginia and mentored dozens of mediators working on their qualifications.

","I only believe in the facilitative approach to mediation. I believe that any other approach is actually not mediation.

As a mediator, I work with individuals and businesses to find creative, effective resolution to all types of disputes regarding relationships &amp;#8212; those in the workplace, family, neighborhood or business. I take great satisfaction in guiding parties towards resolution by allowing them to stay in charge of the mediation process and find their own options for creative problem solving. I am patient, insightful and a skilled communicator sensitive to cultural and socio-economic differences.
I am available to mediate with parties in-person or online using Zoom Video Conferencing, depending on which method meets all of our needs.

Mariani Mediation Services LLC can help you assess the best way to move from conflict to resolution.
  
Amy Cashore Mariani has been assisting individuals and companies in resolving conflict for over twenty years, first during her career as a trial attorney, and then as a trained mediator, conciliator, and facilitator. She believes every party's interests differ, and that each case is unique. Through dialogue and separate reflection, she assists parties in prioritizing interests and assessing potential resolutions.
Amy has over twenty years of experience as a trial attorney. After graduating from Boston College Law School, she worked for a general practice firm representing the interests of individuals and small businesses in personal injury, employment, and contracts cases. She then worked for several nationally recognized firms on product liability and employment matters before becoming a partner at New England's premier minority and women owned law firm, where she handled personal injury, products liability, commercial, employment, and wage and hour claims.
Amy received extensive training in mediation, facilitation, and conciliation at MCLE and the Community Dispute Settlement Center. After completing a practicum with CDSC, she joined their panel of neutrals in 2014. She has mediated personal injury, employment, wage and hour, and commercial disputes involving individuals, small businesses, and the largest of corporations.

In my role as mediator, I guide clients through all of the issues that need to be addressed in their Agreement, keeping clients focused on the issues in order to keep the process as productive and efficient as possible.

Bringing 35 years of experience to the mediation table, I share with clients all of the legal information they need in order to make informed choices and I offer creative solutions to bridge the gap of disagreements, so that the parties can reach a mutually agreeable, workable settlement.
Once all agreements are reached between the parties, I prepare a thorough, well-crafted written Agreement for signature.

I have been a career banker since 1973 spending 26 years in banking. I have a construction lending background assisting parties acquiring construction loans, follow through during the build, construction draws and conversion to the permanent loan.
I became interested in mediation in the early 1990's and completed my 40 hour basic in 1994. In 1998, I became the 162nd Certified Professional Mediator with the Idaho Mediation Association. My banking background has made property and assets based settlements a success for my mediation clients.
1997 to 2005  
I contracted with a judge who allowed mediation to be a very prevalent process of the court. Honorable Judge Williamson and I petitioned the County Commissioners for a mediation budget. In 1998 I began contracting with Valley County mediating on a volume of 10 to 50 small claim cases per year. I have continued providing this service for over seven years; mediating over 150 small claims cases since the program began in 1998. In excess of 150 case hours for small claims.
I began a small business for Private Sector Mediation in 2005, and I am still serving clients through 2017, specializing in complex property/portfolio settlements, impasse cases that have received a judgement without a property settlement or business/partnership disputes and long running litigation cases requiring a final settlement. My Private Sector and Court Ordered case hours to date exceed 450 hours of mediation.

Traditional litigation processes tend to feed and escalate conflict. I feel people are better served by maintaining control over results and managing conflict in a way that engages rather than divides. Since 2007, I've focused my practice on client centered alternatives to litigation including mediation and Collaborative Process. A successful outcome begins with identifying your interests, needs and goals. Skilled communication moves the process forward. Agreements are reached when interests are prioritized and addressed.
  
I am an attorney who has practiced family law in Washington State since 2001. In 2007, I trained in Mediation and Collaborative Law process and began focusing entirely on helping families resolve issues without court intervention. Since then, I've completed hundreds of additional training hours in communication, interest based dispute resolution, and co-parenting coaching. In April 2019, I completed the required number of observed mediation hours for Mediator Certification from the VOAWW Dispute Resolution Center in Snohomish County. In addition, I have a special interest in recovery from substance use disorders and the impact of these diseases on the family system.

I refreshed my mediation training in 2010 and added mediation services to my family practice. Although the skills in Collaborative Practice and Mediation are similar, there is a key difference &amp;#8211; mediators are neutral and do not give advice whereas Collaborative Process attorneys represent and advise one party. I've been practicing as a solo mediator but wanted Certification which requires observation by other trained mediators. In September 2017, I began the Practicum program at the VOAWW Dispute Resolution Center in Snohomish County in order to complete the observed mediation hours required to earn Mediator Certification. I received Certification in April 2019 and continue to volunteer at the DRC in addition to my private practice.&lt;/p&gt;
","I primarily practice interest based mediation (generally referred to as Facilitative Mediation). This means that I work with parties to identify their goals, needs, and interests as well as the needs and interests of children if the participants are parents. Then I facilitate a conversation where participants consider ideas and resolutions that value and incorporate their needs and interests. Parties in this style of mediation have a strong interest in maintaining control over the resolution and avoiding court intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
The interest based approach differs in significant ways from the evaluative settlement process often used by litigation attorneys. In that mediation process, the parties are generally in separate rooms with their attorneys and the mediator   shuttles   offers back and forth. It is a more give and take negotiation with the specter of a looming trial strongly influencing the result. This process can be helpful in some cases but generally feels more adversarial.&lt;/p&gt;

Buckfire (Larry Buckfire) earned his undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Michigan in 1986 and his juris doctor degree from Wayne State University School of Law in 1989. He has been in private practice since successfully completing the bar exam in 1989. He is admitted to practice law in the State of Michigan, State of Ohio, and in the United States District Court.
Lawrence is the lead trial attorney&nbsp;and managing partner at Buckfire &amp;amp; Buckfire, P.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;The law&nbsp;firm was founded in 1969 by his father David Buckfire with the principle of representing clients with the highest degree of integrity, compassion, and professionalism.&nbsp; Lawrence's mother, Vicky Buckfire, &nbsp;joined David in the firm several years later.&nbsp; Lawrence and Daniel both joined their parents upon their completion of law school.
Mr. Buckfire has devoted his legal career to helping the most vulnerable members of our society, children and the elderly.&nbsp; He specializes in child lead paint poisoning, wrongful death, nursing home neglect, medical malpractice, and other serious injury cases. &ldquo;Successfully pursuing these cases is the best way to protect the members&nbsp;of our community from future harm,&rdquo; said Larry.
Lawrence&nbsp;is a highly skilled trial attorney with a reputation for meticulous trial preparation and presentation. Jurors appreciate his attention to detail and his professional manner.&nbsp; He has won substantial verdicts over his career, including a&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;$5 million verdict&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;in an assisted living wrongful death lawsuit.

Robin Masson,robin@massonmediator.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Robin-Masson,,Masson Mediation,"I am passionate about mediation because it works. Not only does it cost less than going to court, but you, the clients, are in control of the process and the outcome. You engage in constructive problem-solving that maximizes each person's satisfaction. Mediation is private and confidential. And it honors relationships among family members, in the community, and among business associates.  
I am a former litigation attorney and, despite my best efforts to resolve matters amicably, I also had the painful experience of having to sue my former law partner to enforce our partnership agreement. So, I know, first-hand, just how disempowering, expensive, and time consuming it can be to resolve conflict through the courts. And I also know how limited the options available in court are. So, I transitioned from &ldquo;gladiator&rdquo; to &ldquo;facilitator,&rdquo; and I have spent the last 25 years as a mediator, helping clients to resolve their disputes with creative solutions that give each person more of what's important to him/her, while tailoring the result to the unique needs of the parties.
  
I am a former New York litigator, who became a committed collaborative attorney and mediator; having moved to California, I am continuing to practice as a mediator.

myself as a peacemaker, serving as a bridge for parties to  
communicate during one of the most difficult times in their lives.  
I aspire to provide my clients with a sense of trust in my  
abilities to calmly move them through the mediation process and  
help them to craft reasonable and mutually-agreeable settlements.  
My mediation process is client-centered and tailored to meet the  
objectives of each party. Mediation is a forum in which  
you have complete control over decision-making. It is  
my job to help the parties navigate the settlement process and be  
the neutral voice in the room, and sometimes to be the objective  
voice of reason. As your Mediator, I will help you draft  
documents required by the Santa Clara County Superior Court, as  
well as file the required documents. I will educate parties on  
the law, while not advocating for either party.

settlement is really a win-win for both sides, most especially  
when there are children involved.

Cole AIA, Esq. is a Certified Mediator and Arbitrator and a Chicago based Illinois and Florida licensed attorney (20 years), and Illinois licensed architect (25 years). He draws upon his dual expertise in law and architecture to provide Certified Mediator and arbitrator services for parties in construction, real estate, commercial, ADA and historic preservation disputes.
His combined legal and construction industry experience allows him unique insights into disputes that result in fairer arbitration awards and mediations with a high record of settlement. His dual professional backgrounds allow him to fluently communicate with disputing parties and their counsel in the industry-specific languages of law, design and construction.
He is also an experienced member of the American Arbitration Association's (AAA) construction and commercial panels of arbitrators and mediators, including its Fast Track, Regular Track, Large, Complex Construction Dispute Panel and its Large Complex Commercial Dispute Panel. He can also serve ad hoc as arbitrator and mediator if so requested.
Mr. Cole serves the Chicago area as well as Central Illinois, and has served out-of-state as arbitrator and mediator in such states as Wisconsin, Indiana and North Dakota. He can travel anywhere in the United States to provide Certified Mediator and arbitration services. Mr. Cole can accommodate court-ordered and very short notice mediation, depending on the specifics and timing.

Upon request, he is happy to provide an estimate of his total fees prior to commencement of his mediator or arbitrator services.&lt;/p&gt;
Mr. Cole will travel anywhere in the continental United States as arbitrator and mediator at no cost for either travel time or direct travel expenses to parties for arbitration hearings or mediation conferences that last three (3) days or more. For arbitration hearings or mediation conferences lasting one (1) or two (2) days, direct reimbursable travel expenses and reasonable travel time are billed to the parties as agreed upon between Mr. Cole and the parties at the commencement of his services.&lt;/p&gt;
","GARY L. COLE, AIA, ESQ. has served as both a Certified Mediator and an arbitrator in over seventy-five (75+) construction, commercial and real estate-related disputes, ranging from $10,000 to over $15,000,000 in claims involving a wide variety of complex dual-party and multi-party claims and counterclaims under American Institute of Architects (AIA) and other industry-standard and custom construction agreements and real estate documents.&lt;/p&gt;
He has arbitrated and mediated many complex condominium and single-family homeowner disputes between owners, developers, contractors, subcontractors and home owner associations. He frequently mediates and arbitrates pro se cases, where one or more parties represents themselves without an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
DISPUTED ISSUES have included contract performance failure and breach, claims involving design and construction defects, material and structural failure, change order disputes, uncompleted punch list issues, HVAC non-performance, scheduling and delay claims, non-payment and mechanics lien claims, cost overruns, unforeseen site conditions including foundation and caisson issues, fraud allegations, code compliance, partnership development agreement issues, alleged intellectual property and related copyright infringement issues, foreclosure, loan modification and asset relinquishment, and a wide range of other construction and commercial claims and disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
","Mr. Cole tailors each mediation's approach to the needs of the dispute and desires of the parties. He draws from his backgrounds as an experienced construction and real estate attorney, and as a licensed architect to provide an   Evaluative/Facilitative   mediation approach, which includes examining the parties' pre-mediation conference document submissions to understand each parties' allegations, arguments and documentary evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
Prior to a mediation conference, he discusses separately and confidentially with each party their positions and goals along with what he considers to be each parties' positions' strengths and weaknesses based on his review of the parties' document submissions. These informed evaluations allows parties to evaluate and consider whether a mediated settlement is in their best interest, or, whether binding dispute resolution such as arbitration or litigation offer better possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
During the mediation conferences, he guides the parties through discussions of the more legally and technically problematic aspects of their disputes. These discussions, along with his pre-mediation conference confidential evaluations of each parties' positions' strengths and weaknesses, allow the parties to continuously evaluate and re-evaluate their positions and their settlement options as the mediation conference progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
Mr. Cole is happy to discuss his mediation approach with the parties, and to tailor it to their desires and expectations for achieving the best opportunity for resolution and settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 - The mediation process allows you to all   win/win,   based on your goals, interests, &amp;amp; needs vs. various positions. 
 - Where there are children this process allows you to focus on what your child needs. 
 - Mediation allows for better communication, healing, respect and dignity than the fault finding and name calling in litigation. 
 - You control the process and outcome, not the Court. 
 - Preserves and honors families vs. tearing them apart. 
 - Mediation is often more cost-effective &amp;amp; efficient than traditional litigation. 
 - The process is confidential &amp;amp; discrete. 
 - Mediation allows for creative, problem solving solutions vs.   cookie cutter   solutions. 
 - Mediation allows you to obtain a more meaningful solution, often at a 85 &amp;#8211; 90% resolution rate.

Cheryl assists couples in working together cooperatively to define issues, negotiate settlements and generate strong and fair agreements based upon their unique and personal circumstances. &nbsp;Mediation allows divorcing couples to be in charge of their own divorce agreement.
The mediation process can improve communication between the couple, helping them avoid future conflicts, which benefits any children involved. Cheryl is also a practicing psychotherapist of 30 years and the Clinical Director at Fox Valley Institute. Adding mediation to her repertoire was a natural one. Utilizing her compassion along with strong listening and collaboration skills Cheryl is able to facilitate clients moving forward in the divorce process in the healthiest and most dignified ways possible.
In Illinois, there are a number of issues the family court requires to be addressed and agreed upon in order to ensure a non-contested divorce.
These issues pertain to:
Children, including Parental Responsibility and Parenting Time ( formally known as legal and physical custody), Division of Assets and liabilities, Child support and Spousal support.
In Mediation, these issues are covered one at a time, in weekly 60 minute sessions. You will continue to meet with your mediator until you feel that all agreements are fair and equitable. The length of the mediation process is determined by the couple.
  
Cheryl has 30 years working with Individuals, Couples and Families as a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist as well as a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor.

Although I am based in the Metro D.C. area, I travel for work with clients throughout the Northeast, and am periodically available for phone/virtual engagements as well.
&lt;hr&gt;
Prior to launching my mediation practice, I was a Director at Jackson &amp;#038; Campbell, P.C., where I represented insurance companies in a broad variety of coverage claims arising from environmental, construction, and other complex civil disputes. 

Core functions of my role included: assessing client needs and opportunities, identifying key factual and legal issues, developing strategies that promoted best possible outcomes for disputes, crafting settlement positions, and negotiating settlements directly or indirectly through mediation.

&bull;	We begin with a conversation to determine what the parties hope to achieve through alternative dispute resolution and how best to proceed in the most helpful way possible.     
&bull;	Throughout the process that follows, I work to equip the parties with the best possible information on their issues, positions, opportunities, and trade-offs.   
&bull;	We then facilitate an organized and intentional conversation or negotiation to explore ways to resolve the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;

It's not about settlement rates or positioning myself to resolve legal problems &ndash; it's about helping parties embrace the process, stay future-focused, and rethink the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

The disputing parties meet in a non-confrontational setting with a trained neutral third-party mediator that facilitates the discussion and process of working together to reach a mutual agreement. Mediation may also be conducted remotely by telephone and electronic means.

&ldquo;Mediation is Conflict at its best&rdquo;  
&lt;/b&gt;
Ken Strongman is a private commercial mediator/arbitrator of complex, high risk litigated cases since 2004.
As a full-time, mediator and arbitrator, Ken Strongman works to unite people into purposeful and unified directions, actions, and efforts by getting under surface appearances. By doing so, he facilitates the parties in developing their unique solutions. Disputes addressed include business, securities, construction defects, real estate, intellectual property, employment, environment, energy, and trusts &amp;amp; estates.
  
Ken Strongman has mediated full time since 2004. Besides an active mediation practice, he is a mediation trainer, and adjunct professor teaching and mentoring new mediators. He routinely speaks and writes on the subject as well.
&lt;b&gt; Successful Mediation Examples: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Real Estate. &lt;/b&gt; Appellant mediation: partners of an incomplete $40 million real estate development disagreed on who owned it and who would go forward with it.
&lt;b&gt; Construction Defects. &lt;/b&gt; HOA v. contractor. The original contract was between the old HOA Board, and the contractor performed work under the new HOA Board. The new Board said the work was not to their specs even though it met municipal code standards.
&lt;b&gt; Business. &lt;/b&gt; Appellant mediation: a national construction products manufacturer acquired a California manufacturer. A multi-million-dollar dispute arose with the acquired company claiming breach of contract, wrongful termination, breach of fiduciary duty, and accounting errors. Before mediation, the parties had participated in 2 private mediations, 4 settlement conferences, and received a jury verdict for the acquiring company after a 5-week trial.
&lt;b&gt; Securities. &lt;/b&gt; A mediation involving a dispute over a 150-million-dollar portfolio.
&lt;b&gt; Employment. &lt;/b&gt; Dispute regarding firm providing for disabilities for an employee.
&lt;b&gt; Technology and Intellectual Property. &lt;/b&gt; A pre-litigation mediation, a $6 million dispute arose after the acquisition of a high-tech company. The contract &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; for an adhesive was different from the &ldquo;real recipe&rdquo;.

","Ken's Mediation Process&lt;/p&gt;
Ken Strongman's overarching purpose is to leave the disputing parties in a better position than when they came to him, by having a major part of helping people to be uniquely outstanding in their own way raising them to their next best level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Leadership:&lt;/b&gt; He is a proven leader performing mediations and teaching others the best practices of the profession; in addition, he has strong roots in the community in service organizations and board memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Goals:&lt;/b&gt; Ken accomplishes this by joining people into a purposeful and unified direction, action or effort, working directly with people, either groups or individuals, communicating ideas, positions, opinions, proposals, and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Vision:&lt;/b&gt; He helps others plan, by helping them visualize future success by translating intangibles in to a picture that is original and distinctive &ndash; developing a strategy to achieve an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Investigation:&lt;/b&gt; Ken works hard investigating, getting under surface appearances gathering information not necessarily provided. The process is to find out things by going to people and inquiring of them either by formally interviewing them or starting a casual conversation which leads to picking their brains.&lt;/p&gt;

Some say disputes are manifestations of deep-rooted conflict. I would say that when unattended, arguments and disputes can easily concretise into conflict &amp;#8211; almost like a normal wound if allowed to fester turn gangrenous. So, the question comes &ldquo;Is dispute a manifestation of inherent conflict OR hardened disputes lead to conflict!?&rdquo; I would say that both are possible depending on the circumstances.  
When parties are in a conflict situation they are in a competitive negative mindset and they always see the glass half empty. So, it is always better to seek advice from a third Neutral party who is not involved in the conflict itself.&lt;/p&gt;

"Robin Sax, JD and LCSW",robin@robinsax.com,"https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Robin-Sax,-JD-and-LCSW",,Dear Co-Parent and Law Offices of Robin Sax,"Robin Sax, JD and LCSW is an experienced attorney and clinical therapist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Robin accepts a limited number of legal cases, Robin's primary practice is Dear Co-Parent where she is a parenting plan coordinator (PPC), mediator, and custody coach who helps parents navigate co-parenting, custody and complex issues related to children.&nbsp; Much of her practice serves clients who find themselves at the intersection of law and mental health particularly cases where there has been abuse, trauma, restraining orders and/or DCFS involvement.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to working with families, Robin coaches individual clients to co-parent and communicate with their ex in a child-centered and effective manner that reduces conflict and keeps children at the center but not in the middle of the issues.
Robin also maintains a limited scope legal practice where she assists people who have a criminal case or cases that require the investigative skills of a former prosecutor.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In her legal practice, Robin's clients run the gamut from victims of crimes to those accused, college students who have been sexually abused, people who have been harassed, the falsely accused, the bullied, the divorcing and parents who need assistance in determining a co-parenting plan or custody plan.&nbsp; Robin works with clients who want to avoid court, those who have cases pending in court, those considering filing a case, as well as people who have administrative hearings, Title IX actions, or DMV hearings.
Robin has developed a special niche in the cases where criminal meets family law and vice versa. For example, these cases can involve domestic violence, child abuse, restraining orders, and sexual abuse. Robin has represented victims of crime as well as the people who have been falsely accused of crimes to gain an advantage in a family law case.
In both her practices, Robin draws on her experience as a former prosecutor as well as a clinical therapist.&nbsp; Robin Sax is a former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney who focused on prosecuting sex crimes against children. As one of the prosecuting attorneys for the Child Sexual Assault division of the Los Angeles County Sex Crimes Unit, Robin worked with a multi-disciplinary team at UCLA's Rape Treatment Center/The Stuart House.&nbsp; While working with law enforcement, victims' advocates, social workers, and members of the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services, she investigated and prosecuted hundreds of child sexual assault cases.
As a therapist, Robin has worked at LAC/USC, The Violence Intervention Program, Green Dot School as well as the Adult Outpatient Psychiatric Unit at Harbor UCLA.&nbsp; Robin is trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectal Behavior Therapy (DBT), Motivational Interviewing (MI), Prolonged Exposure (PE), Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT), MAP/Practicewise, and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT).
Prior to focusing on crimes against children, Robin handled hundreds of other cases including driving under the influence, theft, murder, robbery, and the like. She has conducted hundreds of contested hearings and trials for both the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office as well as the Riverside County District Attorney's Office.
Robin is a nationally recognized expert in child sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse. She is an in-demand public speaker on topics where family law and criminal law intersect&ndash;child sexual assault, family violence, domestic abuse, stalking, and Internet abuse. &nbsp;Sax regularly shares her valuable insight and expertise as a legal analyst for such networks as NBC, ABC, CNN, and CBS analyzing high-profile cases and causes.
Robin has written six books that draw upon her vast experience as a criminal lawyer, legal commentator, child advocate and parenting expert.&nbsp; The titles of her books include: &ldquo;The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Criminal Justice System&rdquo; and &ldquo;Predators and Child Molesters: &nbsp;A Sex Crimes DA Answers 100 of the Most Asked Questions&rdquo; all of which draw on her vast experience as a prosecutor and victim rights advocate. Her powerful insights regularly appear in Huffington Post, Psychology Today, People Magazine, The New York Times, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, The Los Angeles Times and the Women in Crime Ink blog.

Working with Robin Sax involves a careful and structured process to ensure a smooth, transparent, and conflict-free collaboration. If you are a lawyer, please feel free to share this with your client and opposing counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
Here are the key steps to potentially work with Robin Sax/Dear Co-Parent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 - &lt;strong&gt;Initiate Contact:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - Reach out to Robin's intake system by emailing &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:casemanager@robinsax.com&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;casemanager@robinsax.com&lt;/a&gt; (copying Robin at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:robin@robinsax.com&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;robin@robinsax.com&lt;/a&gt;) or call the office at 424-402-1729.&lt;/li&gt;
 - &lt;strong&gt;Provide Information in order for us to complete a conflict check (you can reply to this email with this information too):&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - A. Your first and last name.&lt;/li&gt;
 - B. Names of other potential parties involved in the case&lt;/li&gt;
 - C. Contact information, including email, phone, and physical address.&lt;/li&gt;
 - D. Name/contact information of any lawyers involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
 - &lt;strong&gt;Joint Services (Co-Parenting, Mediation, PPC):&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - If seeking joint services, forward this email or your initial email to the co-parent/spouse/partner, copying the office so everyone sees the same communication at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
 - A conflict check will be performed to ensure there are no conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
 - &lt;strong&gt;Conflict Check (needed for all clients, individual and joint conflicts):&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - The office will perform a conflict check, requesting the first and last names and contact information &nbsp;(email, physical address, and phone numbers) of all parties.&lt;/li&gt;
 - This step ensures there are no conflicts that could compromise the working relationship with Robin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
 - &lt;strong&gt;Intake Form:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - Once conflicts are cleared, prospective clients will receive an individual intake form.&lt;/li&gt;
 - This form should be filled out as completely as possible to expedite scheduling.&lt;/li&gt;
 - This comprehensive form is the first step to scheduling a consultation with Robin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
 - &lt;strong&gt;Free Informational Zoom with Robin Sax:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 - After conflicts are cleared, clients have the opportunity for a 20-minute informational Zoom call with Robin Sax.&lt;/li&gt;
 - During this call, Robin will explain her practice philosophy, work style, and background.&lt;/li&gt;
 - She will review office policies, procedures, and fees and answer any questions clients may have.&lt;/li&gt;
 - If attorneys want to attend this meeting, they may but both attorneys shall be invited if there are two attorneys involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This meticulous process ensures that clients and Robin Sax can establish a clear understanding, free from conflicts of interest, and allows for a comprehensive intake before moving forward with consultations and services.&lt;/p&gt;

In my mediation practice, I employ a thoughtful and directive approach, combining legal acumen with therapeutic skills to guide parties through the resolution process. I believe in fostering an environment where individuals feel heard and acknowledged, recognizing the significance of allowing each party to express their perspectives openly.&lt;/p&gt;
By creating a space for genuine dialogue, I aim to unveil the areas of true importance to each participant. This process not only facilitates a deeper understanding of individual needs and concerns but also assists in pinpointing common ground. I have found that, more often than not, parties are not as far apart in their views as they initially perceive.&lt;/p&gt;
A key facet of my mediation style is the encouragement of a non-defensive atmosphere. I understand the natural inclination to be guarded during conflict, and I work to dismantle those defenses, allowing for more productive and constructive conversations. By alleviating defensiveness, individuals can better engage with one another, leading to a more effective mediation process.&lt;/p&gt;
Moreover, I am mindful of both financial and emotional resources throughout the mediation journey. I recognize the importance of efficient use of time and financial investments, striving for a resolution that is not only legally sound but also considers the broader emotional and psychological impact on the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
In my practice, I focus on uncovering common goals shared by the parties. By emphasizing these shared objectives, I aim to redirect attention away from adversarial positions toward collaborative solutions. This collaborative approach not only fosters a more amicable resolution but also ensures that the mediation process serves as a platform for building consensus and finding mutually beneficial outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Lucy Nichols focuses her practice on working with families in conflict who have children. As an experienced family mediator, her goal is to help families make their own important parenting decisions. Lucy emphasizes the undeniable evidence that parental conflict is the single worst predictor for a child's adult life and relationships. By reducing conflict, parents can shift to a more child-centered approach for resolving their legal issues. Once parents are able to see their child's needs through child-focused lenses, they are ready to find compromises and reach resolutions that best serve their child and meet the parents' common goal of raising a healthy, happy, well-adjusted child.
Lucy also mediates: custody modification, relocation, child support, blending families, reconciling families, elder care mediation, parent-child conflict, parent and adult child conflict, same sex families, Christian Conciliation, and marital separations including issues of division of property and spousal support.
Lucy is certified by the Virginia Supreme Court as a Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court mediator, a Circuit Court mediator for family cases and as a Mentor Mediator. Lucy also served as a Roster Mediator for the Fairfax Juvenile &amp;amp; Domestic Relations District Court for 5 years,&nbsp; working with a diverse group of clients who were already in litigation and often in very high conflict situations.&nbsp; Lucy has her own private mediation practice and also serves as a Christian Conciliator with Conflict to Peace.&nbsp; Lucy has dedicated over 32 years to helping families in conflict, first as a family lawyer and now&nbsp; as a mediator.

The heart of Solace is children, for we do not want one additional child to be negatively affected by divorce; the foundation of Solace is self-care and self-love, for you must take care of yourself when you are going through one of the most emotionally difficult times in your life; the soul of Solace is authenticity, giving you an opportunity to share your truth; and at the root, Solace guides our clients through their &nbsp;journey of healing. We provide our clients with the resources, tools, and skills to help them learn, heal, and grow through their divorce journey and to emerge from the process stronger and more aligned with their life purpose than when they began. Solace recognizes that when people go through divorce they are no longer the caterpillar of their old life, and they are not yet the beautiful butterfly of their new life, they are in the goo of the divorce cocoon&amp;#8230; where it is dark, and heavy, and filled with uncomfortable emotions. Solace helps our clients get out of the divorce goo by shifting the way they are viewing and experiencing their divorce journey, from one of destruction to one of empowerment and growth!

Jen Mitchell has been a family law attorney in Illinois since 2006. Jen practiced as a litigation attorney for the first nine years of her career, serving as the zealous advocate to her clients and advocating for their best interests. After having three children in 39 months, Jen realized that her role in a fundamentally broken family law litigation system was destroying children, families, and people, with the negative effects expanding to the World.  
As such, Jen referred all of her litigation cases out and started to focus on creating a NEW way to help couples go through the emotionally difficult divorce process. She created Solace Divorce Mediation, which offers a proprietary process that helps couples restructure their relationship from &ldquo;married&rdquo; to &ldquo;friends&rdquo; or &ldquo;co-parents&rdquo; with a solid foundation of communication, trust, and respect.  
Divorce is just as much a legal process as it is an emotional process. Having gone through her own divorce in August 2019, Jen knows how difficult the emotional roller coaster can be and how important it is to create a strong co-parenting relationship for the benefit of your family. Jen incorporates her life coaching skills into her process to provide valuable resources and tools for clients to utilize that enable them to learn as much as they can about themselves, heal from past traumas and experiences that are blocking them, and grow into the people they were meant to be!

Our goal is to help create paths to more positive outcomes when important issues are on the line and communication can be most difficult.
Founded by Erik M Feig, an accomplished attorney and parent in a neurodiverse family himself, our practice has a particular interest in working with the unique issues and challenges facing parents in families where neurodiversity and special needs are factors. We bring a practical, real-world approach to help parents engage each other more constructively when decisions impacting their neurodivergent children are required.
We also serve families seeking to resolve issues that extend beyond the immediate family to impact broader relationships, especially among adult siblings and aging family members. Discussions involving life stage decisions, such as elder care, advanced directives, estate planning, living arrangements, aging in place, financial and estate planning, as well as issues involving family gatherings, cherished heirlooms, or sharing the caretaking load can trigger strong emotions, whether family relationships are strained or close.
We help our clients engage more productively so that instead of being stuck on old patterns and resentments, they can focus on what's next. We appreciate that every family and every business we work with is unique. We offer process to help each of our clients find ways to align with each other.
  
Erik M. Feig founded Feig Mediation Group in Bethesda, Maryland, to help parents, families and businesses create more positive outcomes when communication is difficult. He is a mediator, accomplished attorney and a parent of three amazing children.
As a mediator, he is committed to helping his clients align with each other when important issues and decisions need to be addressed and the old, familiar ways of doing things are no longer sufficient to meet the needs of today &ndash; or tomorrow.
It's an approach that recognizes &ndash; and seeks to mitigate against &ndash; the stress and harm that can result from poor or ineffective communication and unresolved conflict.
As a parent in a neurodiverse family himself, Mr. Feig has a particular commitment to working with parents where neurodiversity and special needs are factors in their families.
Mr. Feig's extensive toolset upon which he can draw for the benefit of the clients he serves sets him apart from so many practitioners with &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; notions of what mediation can achieve.
His experience and training extends to both family mediation and business mediation, including parent alignment issues, separation and divorce (e.g., co-parenting and child access issues, and economic issues such as division of property and assets, and support), high conflict family disputes, elder and adult family mediation, parenting coordination, and collaborative law practice.
Combining all of this with a background in engineering, Mr. Feig helps his clients step back to see the bigger picture so they can better explore what's possible.

Matthew received his Juris Doctorate from the Quinnipiac University School of Law after attending Villanova University for his undergraduate degree.

Matthew supports his clients with navigating the stressful ups and downs inherent in the divorce process, acknowledging the difficult decisions his clients will need to make while encouraging them to focus on the positive outcomes they are working towards. Matthew believes that the process works best when his clients are able to work toward mutual resolutions of their conflicts, specific to themselves and their family, rather than acquiescing to the uncertainty of result that comes with bringing their controversies in front of the court, regardless of whether the matter is being litigated or mediated.

","The one thing that Joy loves most about mediation is the control and power that it gives to the parties in determining their own outcomes. You know what is best for you. You shouldn't have to be told by attorneys and judges what you have to live with. Mediation gives the people who are impacted the most with the decisions made, control in making those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
Joy's approach to dispute resolution is flexible based upon the needs of the parties and the type of dispute being resolved. Understanding the needs of the parties in resolving the dispute helps to identify if her role as mediator should be more facilitative or evaluative. She strives to assist the parties to be at their best so that they can effectively determine their best outcome. She encourages collaboration, focused communication and creative problem-solving so that the parties can find solutions that work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

After several years of representing the State of Georgia in criminal cases, he was made an offer he couldn't refuse by a defense lawyer whom he had tried several cases against. The offer was to leave prosecution, and to undertake to protect the rights of those accused of DUI and related cases.

I am Ron, a mediator with a deep-rooted passion for resolving conflict that began at the USCG Aviation Technical Training Center. There, amidst the development of the Helicopter Rescue Swimmer program, I learned invaluable dispute resolution skills that have underpinned every role since, from enforcing international treaties to navigating complex multi-casualty investigations and large-scale project misunderstandings.
I pledge to you not just professional support, but a compassionate and empathetic presence, with a steadfast belief in your right to direct the resolution of your dispute. While conflict can stir stress, my life experiences, from military service to coaching and pet parenting, have equipped me with an empathy that will guide us toward a peaceful resolution.
In the face of conflict, we all need resilience and the ability to emerge stronger. As your mediator, I've facilitated spaces where each voice is heard and every concern is addressed, always with an emphasis on self-determination. My aim is to help craft fair, mutually agreeable outcomes that consider everyone's needs.
I stand ready to offer insights from my diverse background, guiding you towards a resolution that restores harmony to your life. Together, we will work patiently and with understanding to find a solution that truly meets your needs. Let's move forward, hand in hand, toward a resolution that works for you.
As a mediator, I've had the privilege of assisting others to resolve issues and conflicts. I've seen firsthand the delicate balance of interests, fears, and hopes that each party brings to the table. My role is to facilitate a safe and respectful space where everyone feels seen, heard, and understood. I appreciate the importance of these situations and the crucial role of self-determination in crafting resolutions that are considerate, fair, and mutually agreeable.
I stand ready, offering insights gleaned from my personal and professional experiences, to journey with you towards resolution. Our quest isn't just about resolving a conflict; it's about empowering you and restoring harmony to your life. Together, with patience, understanding, and a shared commitment, we will strive to find a solution that respects your needs and rights.

After an agreement to mediate is reached, Ron initiates the process with a caucus for each party involved. This step is crucial as it allows him to understand the unique needs and positions, ensuring that every voice is truly heard.&lt;/p&gt;
In the workspace, Ron skillfully sets the stage for change management initiatives, ensuring that the solutions agreed upon are not just theoretical, but actionable and effective. He follows up post-agreement to ensure these changes are successfully implemented and to assess their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
When dealing with post-incident scenarios or root cause analyses, Ron's facilitated mediation supports a culture of fairness and learning. He incorporates sensemaking into the process, which is essential for developing resilient solutions that tackle the complexities and risks inherent in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;
In the midst of conflict, whether you're grappling with concerns about financial loss, client relationships, job security, reputation, production capacity, or even your identity within your organization, Ron's method keeps the mediation process straightforward and focused on addressing these concerns. With a comprehensive examination of the facts and a careful consideration of all options, he helps you evaluate both the emotional and financial implications for your present and future. Ron's approach ensures that you are equipped with the necessary guidance and tools, empowering you and your organization to take charge of the future with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8211;
Conflict can be destabilizing and difficult, but everyone has the ability to resolve conflict and regain that stability. My job is to support you in this process, allowing you to come to long-term meaningful resolutions.
I provide virtual mediation services via a variety of platforms, and can provide in-person mediation within NYC.
I often co-mediate with a male mediator to ensure gender balance in the room. That does not add any cost to you, but helps parties feel comfortable and safe in the process, which can lead to a faster and stronger resolution.
I have extensive experience working with clients with mental health and accessibility needs and provide trainings on creating empowering spaces for clients with mental health needs. I'd be happy to talk to you about how to make the process accessible for you.
  
I came to mediation from litigation, where I repeatedly saw that parties in conflict ended up worse off and more disempowered than they were previously as a result of the court system.
As an attorney, I understand the court system and the various paths a dispute might take. My goal is to help parties in conflict avoid the cost, time and stress of navigating the court system.
I also sit on the ADR subcommittee of the NYC Bar Association.
_______
I also have experience mediating in interfaith and faith based spaces.

I'm trained and have practiced in divorce mediation, custody &amp;amp; visitation mediation, elder/adult family mediation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; mediations involving domestic/intimate partner violence.&lt;/p&gt;
I teach mediation at Hofstra Law School&lt;/p&gt;
I am a volunteer mediator for Small Claims Court and Community Mediation Services.&lt;/p&gt;
I'm also trained in restorative justice and believe that mediation can be a healing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
","My approach is that mediation is not just a faster cheaper way to resolve conflict than litigation(although it is). I have seen that mediation provides an opportunity for you to share your story, understand your own perspective better and get a better understanding of the person you're in conflict with's point of view as well.&lt;/p&gt;
Parties are happier with resolutions when they come to them themselves. You are an expert in your own life, so it makes sense that you're in the best position to come to a resolution that leaves you feeling satisfied and stronger. It may feel like at the beginning of mediation you need guidance or that the person you're in conflict with needs to be told what to do, but I've seen time and time again people start in intractable disputes and come to resolutions they feel good about.&lt;/p&gt;
My approach is mediation looks like you want it to look. I'd love to talk to you more about what that means and how it applies to your conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
I also find there are times that co-mediation with two mediators is very beneficial for parties. I partner with another mediator from a different faith background for interfaith mediations including decision making around weddings and children as well as interfaith divorces.&lt;/p&gt;

I mediate for people with or without lawyers, for cases in court or for those hoping to avoid court altogether, virtually or in person at my office.  I can assist any family in NC.  Our goal is a fair and wise agreement that will reduce family conflict, which is particularly important for families with children.  You can avoid the astronomical cost of court and years of conflict and uncertainty by using mediation to expeditiously and fairly resolve all issues so you can both move forward into a new future.
&lt;hr&gt;
I am a lawyer who spent over a decade litigating family cases in NC.  I also previously served as NC District Court Judge.  Litigating and deciding these cases convinced me that court is the very last place that families should end up but it is usually the first place they go when separation occurs.

In 2019 I was appointed to a judicial vacancy in NC and served through the end of 2020.  In 2021, I renewed my mediation certification and focused my practice on family mediation.&lt;/p&gt;
","When possible, I use interest based negotiation, trying to assist parties in reaching an agreement that will meet each of their needs.

The Weinstein Law Group, PLLC has more than three decades of practice in representing victims of construction accidents. Given the heightened amount of risk involved, construction sites are heavily observed by state and federal safety regulations. However, despite the strict criteria that govern construction work, multiple parties involved often fail to protect their workers. Construction site owners, equipment manufacturers, general contractors, and sub-contractors may all play a role in a construction accident. However, all of these forces will do whatever they can to minimize their responsibilities when a worker is hurt. You don't have to go through the complicated insurance claims process alone. Work with a skilled New York construction accident lawyer who can fully investigate your accident, determine each party's liability, and guide you through the legal process. The bottom line is that any time you're wounded on a construction job, you need to look out for yourself and your family. Contact The Weinstein Law Group, PLLC today, and we'll offer you a complimentary case consultation.

Frederick Wagner,fjwagner@fjwagnerlaw.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Frederick-Wagner,,Law Office of Frederick J. Wagner,"My practice is dedicated to helping parties resolve their civil litigation matters, using my litigation background to help adversarial parties evaluate the risks involved in proceeding to trial versus settling their dispute on their own, mutually agreeable terms. It also allows parties a chance to either avoid proceeding to, or shortening the length of, litigation. If you need an experienced neutral, who will work toward getting your dispute resolved, contact me today to discuss whether I can assist you with your concerns. I am a Credentialed Advanced Mediator from the Texas Mediator Credentialing Association, and an AV Preeminent Rated Attorney, involved in civil litigation matters for more than 30 years. My litigation and mediation practices have involved premises liability, products liability, transportation related claims, and general negligence involving personal injury and wrongful death. I have also handled matters related to toxic tort, subrogation, first party insurance and breach of contract/lease and consumer claims.
  
I spent nearly twenty years representing clients and businesses in cases involving personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, premises liability, toxic tort and business-related claims, with many of those cases involving mediation as the preferred method to resolve the dispute. I next took that experience in evaluating liability and damages for my clients with me as I started my work as a mediator. For over a decade, I have assisted parties in resolving their civil disputes in many of the same areas in which I practiced as a litigator.

","In over thirty years of civil litigation practice, I have handled a variety of different types of cases, involving various areas of the law. This gives me an insight into the types of litigation that most individuals and businesses encounter, and experience in evaluating potential strengths and weaknesses of each side. In my civil practice, I have represented clients in hundreds of mediations, and recognize the important role that dispute resolution plays in our legal system. I am firm in my belief that mediation can be an effective tool in resolving contentious or emotional disputes between parties, whether they involve alleged tortfeasors and injured parties, or two companies in a business dispute. It is this experience and belief that I bring to each mediation. I offer my services as a neutral to interested parties, seeking to resolve their differences in a controlled, confidential environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Erin Colgan,ekcolgan@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Erin-Colgan,,"Erin K. Colgan, P.C.","I am Erin Colgan, the founder and managing partner of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://erincolganlaw.com/about-the-firm/&quot;&gt;Colgan Family Law, P.C.&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp; As a seasoned divorce attorney, I help divorcing men and women to navigate the divorce process, address post-divorce concerns, and offer advice to clients as they begin their new chapters. As a former prosecutor, and certified&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://erincolganlaw.com/mediation/&quot;&gt;mediator&lt;/a&gt;, I pride myself on helping each divorcing client to choose the type of divorce that is right for their situation, and tailor the approach, strategy, and negotiation to accommodate their needs.
I pride myself on my ability to help clients understand and anticipate the legal process they face, evaluate their options, plan for the impacts on loved ones, and protect their interests as they navigate the Staten Island divorce and child custody processes and rebuild their lives.
Throughout my legal career of nearly 20 years, I have helped hundreds of men and women navigate their divorces through litigation, advocacy, and often encourage alternative resolution, such as mediation and collaborative divorce. I am equally facile with all types of cases, from simple and amicable to highly contentious. I am also adept in handling the financial aspects of a divorce, including the appraisal of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://erincolganlaw.com/appraisal-and-division-of-marital-assets/&quot;&gt;assets&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and businesses, distribution of pensions, or evaluation of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://erincolganlaw.com/child-custody/&quot;&gt;custody agreements&lt;/a&gt;.
I am also known for helping my clients to formulate the strategy and course of action that best suits their needs. In fact, the firm encourages and develop out of court models, including mediation and out of court negotiations to avoid costly litigation and preserve financial assets. In cases where litigation is unavoidable, we work closely with clients and other professionals to bring swift closure to a difficult process in an informed, efficient, and focused manner.
I understand what my clients are going through. As a divorced parent of two (now young adult) children, I can closely relate to the challenges and rewards that accompany emotional separation and physical transition.
Unlike most other family law firms, Colgan Family Law, P.C. offers pension valuation services to assist divorcing parties directly and other attorneys with drafting orders to divide pension benefits following divorce.
I began my legal career at the Richmond County District Attorney's Office, located in Staten Island, NY, where I worked as an Assistant District Attorney and prosecuted domestic violence cases. After having two children, I went into private practice as an associate at a local matrimonial law firm.
I am a member of the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thercba.com/&quot;&gt;Richmond County Bar Association&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://siwba.org/&quot;&gt;Staten Island Women's Bar Association&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and serves as the Matrimonial Committee co-chair of the Richmond County Bar Association. I am active on the 18b panel and serve as an Attorney for the Child in Richmond County.&nbsp; I am also active on the Collaborative Committee for Richmond County for Child Protective matters through the Office of Court Administration for the State of New York. I have lectured for Continuing Legal Education to my colleagues concerning custody and child protective issues.
I earned my B.S. in Economics and Management Science,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cum laude&lt;/em&gt;, from the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.cortland.edu/&quot;&gt;State University of New York at Cortland&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, and my J.D. from Rutgers-Newark in 2001. I took my first mediation 40 hour training in 2004 at the Center for Divorce Mediation and then took the 40 hour course to be accredited as part of the 146 panel in the ADR program in Richmond County. I am admitted to practice in New York.

","&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Let's face it, divorce is a stigmatized word. It evokes a range of emotions from fear to anger and hurt. Divorce is generally not a positive experience, but one that must happen if a spouse or both spouses wish to end their legal relationship. We can help take some of the sting and uncertainty out of the process by helping divorcing partners and parents by guiding them through this and letting them process their feelings and thoughts in a collaborative way with a goal in mind. That goal is to streamline the divorce process in a way that causes no harm or added conflict, manages expectations, and identifies shared end goals for everyone. Along the way, our firm can offer additional professionals to support you through this as needed.&nbsp; When opting to mediate a divorce, parties have consciously chosen to participate in a collaborative process that will with the assistance of the mediator and up with a full settlement of all the issues that in divorce.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Who is it for? Many folks will benefit from mediation. The no-court, confidential options suited for many people. But, by far, helping parents through a difficult time and making children's lives more peaceful is what I value most on a personal level. I see the harm that is sometimes caused by overly aggressive and high conflict cases, and I always jump at an opportunity to dial down any conduct that could damage a child.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The indelible mark of divorce is something that a child will carry permanently- and they have no role in deciding that their family unit will be changing. So, to honor the children by thoughtfully pursuing a peaceful divorce is something I will always encourage. Divorcing parents can often find support with the assistance of an experienced mediator.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Erin is a trained litigator with many years of advocating for her clients in the courtroom. She has parlayed the knowledge and skills acquired and transferred them to helping couples fairly and equitably have the discussions necessary to divide and transition to a post-divorce family. She reminds couples of their continued role and obligations as parents to their children and works together with her clients to ensure that the children's best interest is held as the highest priority in resolving many difficult parenting issues. During mediation we will discuss and attempt to resolve complex parenting schedules, how day to day decisions is made, how time with the children will be shared and when to introduce a new partner. Divorced families present challenges as many families have gone through trauma and difficulties before ever reaching our office. But, with the appropriate resources and sound advice, we can help you transition peacefully and process this divorce in a way to cause your family the least harm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Erin is a certified mediator and has successfully mediated hundreds of cases since 2004. Erin will schedule an informative initial consultation with a couple via Zoom in order to meet and provide information in order to assess if mediation is a good fit. If everyone agrees, then meetings on Zoom or in person can start immediately and the work can get started. Usually, a mediation lasts between 3-6 sessions, although some can take longer if the issues are more complex. Fees are much less than litigation and will save you tens of thousands in legal fees.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Josh Carroll,reports+buzzell@milemarkmedia.com,,Macon Personal Injury &amp, Workers’ Compensation Attorney,"Buzzell, Welsh &amp; Hill","Josh Carroll is a partner in the Macon law firm of Buzzell, Welsh &amp;amp; Hill. A native of Clarkesville, Georgia, he is a 2007 graduate of the Mercer University School of Law in Macon. Mr. Carroll began his legal career at a large insurance defense law firm in Atlanta. He quickly realized he wanted to spend his legal career representing everyday people, not insurance companies, so he returned to Macon in 2008 to join his current firm.
Mr. Carroll is admitted to practice before all state and superior courts in Georgia, as well as the United States District Courts for the Middle District of Georgia and Northern District of Georgia. He regularly practices before the Georgia State Board of Workers' Compensation. He has been admitted pro hac vice in other jurisdictions and has worked as co-counsel with attorneys outside of Georgia on various matters.
Mr. Carroll's practice is evenly divided between handling workers' compensation cases and personal injury cases, including cases involving automobile accidents, trucking accidents, workplace injuries and deaths, wrongful death negligence claims, medical negligence claims, long-term disability insurance disputes, and nursing home neglect cases.

Sean M.  Kohl,reports+kohl@milemarkmedia.com,,Columbus Foreclosure Defense &amp, Consumer Law Attorneys,Kohl &amp, Cook Law Firm LLC,"Sean M. Kohl is an accomplished Ohio and Pennsylvania attorney with a diverse background representing small businesses and consumers against the abuses of the banking and mortgage servicing industry. Too often big law firms and large national banks do not treat local small businesses and consumers fairly. Sean strives to even the playing field in his practice by providing individualized and practical representation to each of his clients based on their unique needs and circumstances.
Sean is an Eagle Scout and grew up in a blue-collar Ohio factory town where he learned the value of hard work, honesty and respect &ndash; values not often shown to small businesses and consumers. Sean received his undergraduate degree from Bowling Green State University and his law degree from Western Michigan Cooley Law School graduating&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cum laude&lt;/em&gt;. Sean worked part-time as a high school teacher and securities regulator for the State of Michigan to put himself through law school where he received national recognition for his litigation skills &ndash; specifically in moot and appellate court competitions.
After law school Sean worked in the oil and gas industry for Oklahoma City based Chesapeake Energy. At Chesapeake, Sean collaborated with Ohio and Pennsylvania landowners to cure and clear oil and gas title to help explore and develop the Utica and Marcellus shale plays. Sean transitioned to corporate law and litigation by accepting a position at Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease, LLP. Sean acquired a great deal of complex business litigation and regulatory experience during his time as a lawyer at Chesapeake and Vorys. However, Sean's true passion is helping people. Big national banks and mortgage companies often hold many unfair advantages over their customers, and Sean fought hard to combat those abuses at Doucet &amp;amp; Associates Co., L.P.A.
Sean wanted to offer personalized and vigorous representation to small businesses and Ohio consumers so he and his business partner, Timothy Cook, established Kohl &amp;amp; Cook, Law Firm LLC. Sean's current practice focuses primarily on mortgage foreclosure defense, consumer protection, and civil litigation combating the abuses of debt collectors and mortgage servicers. Sean also advises small startup businesses as general counsel.
If you need an experienced mortgage foreclosure defense, consumer protection, civil litigation or small business attorney contact Kohl &amp;amp; Cook now for a free consultation.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Successfully fighting criminal defense charges requires quick, strategic action. The period of time before the state attorney's office files formal charges is the best window for avoiding conviction or charges altogether.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;If charges have already been filed, it is important to contact a criminal defense attorney as soon as possible. Before meeting with an attorney, try to gather as many relevant documents as possible, including:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Arrest warrants&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Police documentation of seized items&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Dates and times of future court appearances&lt;/span&gt;

John started his legal career as a Student Assistant at the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office, then did a Judicial Clerkship with Frederick J. Schuck, J.S.C. in Camden, NJ. After his clerkship, John worked on mergers and acquisitions and corporate litigation matters as a Corporate Attorney for two prominent North Jersey law firms, Scarinci &amp;amp; Hollenbeck, LLC and Archer &amp;amp; Greiner LLP. Then, John worked as a Tax Attorney for the Law Offices of Donald G. Koch, P.C. in downtown Manhattan, resolving Tax Controversy matters for businesses and individuals. While at Scarinci &amp;amp; Hollenbeck, LLC, John handled several significant mergers and roll-ups, worked on other significant transactional matters, and worked for two of the firm's significant banking clients.
John has an L.L.M. in Taxation from NYU School of Law, a J.D. from Brooklyn Law School, and has studied corporate finance at Columbia University Graduate School of Business. Prior to law school, John attended The College of New Jersey and earned a B.S. in Business Management, a B.A. in English, and a minor in Political Science.
During law school, John was a member of the Moot Court Honor Society and the Journal of Law and Policy, the Corporate and Real Estate Clinic and the Prosecutor's Clinic. John's Moot Court team won the National Appellate Tax Oral Advocacy competition and both best oralist awards. John also competed nationally with the trial side of the Moot Court program on the school's TYLA National Trial Advocacy Team, coached by Michael Vecchionne, First Assistant District Attorney at the Brooklyn D.A.'s Office, and one of the most accomplished trial attorneys in the country. At graduation John was awarded both the faculty's Trial Advocacy Prize and the faculty's Real Estate Prize.
While at Brooklyn Law School, John saved a large HDFC building from foreclosure, by working out a loan that had been delinquent for more than twenty (20) years and getting the Department of Finance to re-finance the loan, under the tutelage of Debrah Bechtel, who runs the Corporate and Real Estate Clinic at Brooklyn Law School.
John is licensed to practice in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He is a member of numerous bar associations and committees. John is currently working on completing the requirements to become a New Jersey Certified Civil Trial Attorney.
John's interests outside the office include running marathons and ultramarathons, kickboxing, and working to be a good steward of whatever he is entrusted with. John is a practicing and devoted Christian.

","My approach to mediation is to determine the goals of each participant and to rank those goals in order of priority.&nbsp; I try to determine what is most important to each participant, and what items are less important.&nbsp; To reach compromise I try to find an approach or suggestion wherein each side can budge on items of lesser importance to them and greater importance to their opponent.&nbsp; In doing so, in many cases, both sides can get what they really want most, while giving up things that are of lesser importance.&lt;/p&gt;

Daven  Cameron,reports+cameron@milemarkmedia.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Daven--Cameron,Las Vegas Personal Injury Lawyer,Cameron Law,"Attorney Daven P. Cameron moved to Las Vegas as a child, making Las Vegas his home for nearly 20 years. After graduating high school in Las Vegas, Daven attended the University of Nevada Las Vegas, obtaining his Bachelor of Science degree. Thereafter, Daven attended the William S. Boyd School of Law, graduating at the top of his class. While in law school, Daven served as a judicial intern to The Honorable Richard F. Boulware with the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Throughout law school, Daven received numerous awards for his written and oral advocacy skills and was a member of the law school's premiere traveling moot court team. Daven was also selected as a scholarship recipient by the Las Vegas Business Academy, which awards scholarship to an elite group of students identified as Las Vegas' future leaders. During law school, Daven also gained experience working with the Clark County Public Defender's Office and traveled overseas to research human rights violations in India.
After law school, Daven served as a judicial law clerk to The Honorable Nancy L. Allf with the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada. As a judicial law clerk, Daven was exposed to and worked on a broad range of legal matters involving civil and business litigation. Daven got a behind-the-scenes understanding of how the court system operates while learning from the invaluable perspective of a highly respected judge.
Following his judicial clerkship, Daven practiced civil litigation at a leading national law firm, representing sophisticated business clients. While there, Daven litigated general civil and business cases, corporate derivative actions, complex construction disputes, anti-SLAPP suits, commercial real estate transactions, and catastrophic personal injury. Daven also received numerous awards for his contribution to pro bono.
With years of civil and business litigation under his belt, Daven decided that he wanted to help people (not corporations) and represent those who have been injured and need help. Daven left the big firm life and began working at a personal injury law firm and later worked for some time at a boutique law firm, where he represented clients in personal injury and civil rights.
After acquiring extensive experience in a wide range of cases, including cases that recovered over $50,000,000 for injured victims, Daven established Cameron Law, PLLC, to provide clients with superior legal representation in the practice areas of personal injury and criminal defense. By leveraging Daven's personal injury and litigation experience, with his passion for helping people, Cameron Law, PLLC delivers legal representation that puts the client first.
Daven has received numerous awards for his pro bono work in the community and was voted one of Las Vegas's Legal Elite in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Daven enjoys spending time with his wife and son in his free time, traveling, exercising, and enjoying live music.

Victoria Scarth,victoria@temeculamediation.org,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Victoria-Scarth,,,"Mediation can be a powerful tool to avoid the time, expense and acrimony that are sometimes inevitable in divorce litigation. With mediation, the settlement is tailored to your individual case. You determine how decisions are made and the outcome, not a judge. Mediation can resolve your situation with an agreement that takes care of your individual situation and needs. An added benefit to mediation is that anything said or written in mediation is confidential, which is the opposition in litigation. The only information that becomes public is the mediated agreement that is reached. I offer free consultations over the phone and I'm happy to mediate your case in person or over Zoom. What ever feels most comfortable for both parties.

Valerie J. Botter,contact@botterlaw.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Valerie-J.-Botter,,,"While the decision to end a marriage or relationship is never easy, resolving custody, parenting time, support, and property division need not be difficult or unreasonably expensive. As a Massachusetts divorce and family law mediator, I meet with both parties and help facilitate a satisfactory settlement. A mediated divorce spares clients the expense and stress of protracted lawyer negotiations or a litigated process in which the Judge makes decisions about you and your family's future. Following decades of experience as a mediator and as an attorney in traditional and alternative dispute resolution, and with extensive negotiation and courtroom experience, I now focus my practice exclusively as a mediator and as a collaborative attorney. I mediate separation, divorce, and post-judgment support and co-parenting matters throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I also provide mediation services for prenuptial and postnuptial agreements (referring those clients to collaborative counsel for advice per Massachusetts law).

This means that my mediation clients cannot end the mediation process and then demand that I inform his/her/their new counsel about what happened in mediation or call me as a witness in Court.&lt;/p&gt;
I have conducted many mediations over the years as well advised many clients in my role as an attorney (when a clients was in mediation with another mediator). I bring 35 years of mediation, collaborative negotiation, traditional negotiation, and courtroom experience to the mediation process. I have worked with many attorneys to help settle cases and have a highly successful record of trial outcomes in Court. All of this experience helps me develop unique solutions for families who are separating, divorcing, or having post-divorce issues.&lt;/p&gt;
","I approach each mediation with curiosity, compassion, and detailed attention. I work closely with the participants to ensure full financial disclosure and refer clients to collaborative counsel for advice when requested and when necessary. I enjoy addressing the financial issues of separation and divorce as much as working with parents to develop parenting plans for their children. My personal and professional life experience provides me with a deep understanding and appreciation of the complexity of extended family dynamics and the importance of shielding children from parental conflict during separation and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

Marc Brown,reports+brown@milemarkmedia.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Marc-Brown,Columbia Personal Injury Attorney,,"As someone who has always had a keen sense of right and wrong and a desire to achieve excellence and fairness in all things, pursuing law was a natural career choice. After graduating with honors from the prestigious Emory University School of Law, Marc went on to become a dedicated litigator who focuses on personal injury, workers' compensation, and civil rights cases.
Many personal and professional experiences shaped Marc into the diligent and passionate lawyer he is today. Growing up as a military child, he gained an appreciation for different people, cultures, and experiences while learning to adapt and excel no matter where life took him. Marc feels that learning to be resilient and adaptable at such a young age helps him succeed in his law career. As the son of a career airman stationed at Shaw Air Force Base and an elementary school teacher who retired from the Sumter County Public School System after 35 years of teaching, choosing to establish his practice in South Carolina seemed only fitting. After attending law school and beginning his law practice in Atlanta, Georgia, Marc returned to South Carolina in the fall of 2016 to work for Nelson Mullins Riley &amp;amp; Scarborough LLP, a national law firm with more than 750 lawyers.
Marc's time working for Nelson Mullins equally influenced his career trajectory and exposed him to many different practice areas and prominent mentors. He defended large companies in complex commercial litigation&mdash;including cases dealing with autonomous vehicles, fraud, RICO charges, and wage and hour class actions. Additionally, he worked for a regional civil defense law firm representing insurance companies and businesses in personal injury and workers' compensation cases&mdash;including car accidents, trucking accidents, shooting incidents, wrongful death, nursing home injuries, and work-related injuries.
From law school to his prior work experience, Marc has received some of the best legal training available. Marc's exposure working for insurance companies, large corporations, and private citizens has afforded him the opportunity to observe both sides of a case, witness the diversity each client brings to court, and ultimately refine his skills as an attorney. He knows exactly how insurance companies and corporations evaluate claims and what they look for when deciding to increase the amount of money they are willing to pay. Marc works tirelessly to make sure his clients receive the best results possible.
Marc equally values his family, community, and the practice of law. He finds great purpose and joy volunteering with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Columbia and serving as a board member of both the Children's Trust of South Carolina and Communities in Schools of the Midlands. Marc is married to Kiera, a pharmacist in Columbia, and has a teenage son, Emmanuel&mdash;a motivated young man who is currently earning his high school diploma and associate's degree simultaneously. As a family, Marc, Kiera, and Emmanuel enjoy spending time in the gym, attending Carolina Gamecock football games, traveling, and trying new restaurants

Nicholas Hart,support@harrisonhartlaw.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Nicholas-Hart,,"Harrison, Hart &amp; Davis, LLC","As a law clerk, attorney Nicholas Hart reviewed pro se criminal appeals to determine if there was a case that the Court should review. He clerked for the Honorable Judge James E. Graves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. During that time, he was struck by the criminal justice process and the lack of access to quality representation. He believes that sending a person to jail or prison should be amongst the most difficult decisions made. But, as a society, we have created a culture of incarcerations without pause. He gravitates to the most complex cases because that is where he feels like he can make the most impact.
A person charged with murder or a violent crime is not just fighting for an acquittal or a favorable sentence.

","My approach is non-directive and I follow the belief of the ICF that generally people are creative, resourceful and whole and that given space and time to work out what is happening that they will be able to figure out the best way forward for themselves. Therefore I work one on one with parties before they come together. I am a keen advocate of reflective practice and am a member of three learning and sharing groups where we avail of &amp;#8216;group supervision'. I use a hybrid of approaches but generally find the conflicts that I am asked to intervene is have a large relational component. I work with clients who may have become disconnected from themselves as well as from others on connecting back in with themselves in a real way. From this space it is easier to approach conflict situations.&lt;/p&gt;

She only accepts serious and catastrophic car, truck, motorcycle, or boating accident cases. She is a top Florida injury lawyer who handles all types of personal injury cases, including auto accidents, semi-truck accidents, Uber &amp;amp; Lyft accident cases, negligent security, medical malpractice, birth injuries, brain injuries, paralysis, spinal cord injuries, blindness, fractures, and other serious injury cases.
Are you searching for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://injuryattorneyflorida.com/&quot;&gt;best Orlando personal injury lawyer&lt;/a&gt;? Or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://injuryattorneyflorida.com/car-accident-lawyer-orlando/&quot;&gt;best Florida auto accident lawyer&lt;/a&gt;? Since there is no way to determine how well a lawyer performed, there is no way to know which lawyer is the best Orlando personal injury attorney. For example, one lawyer might obtain a million dollar reward in one case, but another could have obtained 10 million. How would anyone know? The jury can award a range of money and do not explain their reasons, or insurance companies can settle accident cases without explaining why they gave a particular amount. So you should choose the Orlando car wreck law firm that makes you feel most comfortable, after reading about their results, client reviews, and perhaps industry awards.
If you want the &lt;a href=&quot;https://injuryattorneyflorida.com/&quot;&gt;TOP Florida personal injury lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, there is a similar problem. There is no way to know the top Florida personal injury lawyer. Again, there are too many factors for one to evaluate. So, ultimately, you have to rely on reviews, results, and your own gut feeling.
We do advise that you avoid settlement mill law firms, which are law firms where lawyers each handle hundreds of cases.

Neil Forester,neil@foresterfamilylaw.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Neil-Forester,Attorney Owner,Forester Family Law PC,"I have spent much of my career negotiating and litigating divorce cases, and can offer expertise and an   insider   perspective about the realities of family court. My practice emphasizes mediation and arbitration whenever possible as a more efficient alternative to lawsuits, court hearings, and expensive lawyering. When litigation is unavoidable, I provide specialized counseling and strategic guidance for navigating the courtroom.
For more than 18 years, my work has covered marital dissolution, business valuations, property division, child custody orders, child support calculations, and spousal support awards. I also help individuals with prenups, adoptions, cohabitation agreements, LGBTQ+ legalities, and pet parenting contracts.&nbsp; I am certified as an arbitrator by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and as of 2023 hold a Certificate in Dispute Resolution from the Straus Institute for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine University's Caruso School of Law.

My hourly mediator fee is $450, though I also can offer flat fee mediation depending on the complexity of the individual case. My arbitrator rate is $500 per hour, as is my rate in a representative capacity in a mediation or arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
","I have been working in the ADR arena for many years in private settlement conferences, and in stand-alone mediations and arbitrations. I have worked with hundreds of family law clients in varied roles (representative, consultant, mediator, arbitrator), and have focused my practice since 2020 on ADR exclusively. I have conducted dozens of virtual mediations and arbitrations since then, though I have also worked in   in-person   matters during this time. In 2021, I began the process of obtaining some additional credentialing through the Straus Institute for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine University's Caruso School of Law, and earned a Certificate in Dispute Resolution in 2023. I expect to earn my LL.M. degree in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
","In mediation, I typically utilize a blended approach, as each case brings with it its own dynamic and special circumstances. In cases that might benefit from a more   evaluative   approach &amp;#8211; like those that need a risk assessment if mediation fails and litigation becomes necessary &amp;#8211; I lean on my 18+ years as a family law litigator to provide some perspective and a range of possible outcomes that can help parties formulate a more informed settlement. In cases involving more complex emotional or psychological issues, I use a more   facilitative   approach to broaden the settlement discussions and offer creative approaches to resolving particularly difficult issues. The evaluative approach tends to rely more on a   legal   approach to issues, whereas the facilitative model relies more on pragmatism and in finding areas of overlapping interests. Family law matters often involve issues that may require both approaches at different times during the process, and I am comfortable moving in and out of these approaches as the matter requires.&lt;/p&gt;
In my role as arbitrator, I find that a less formalistic approach suits most cases, though if the parties and attorneys express an interest in following a particular set of arbitration rules, I will of course accommodate them. Arbitration is much more of a formal legal process than mediation is, though I will invite the parties and attorneys to work together to resolve issues short of the actual arbitration proceeding if that is possible. If it is not, I favor an efficient process that allows for the arbitration to conclude expeditiously, and will generally issue the award soon after conclusion of the proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently offering mediation via Zoom, and soon offering mediation over Immediation!
Why Zoom?&nbsp; Mediation over Zoom became a popular alternative to in-person mediation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lesa Koski,lesa.koski@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Lesa-Koski,Attorney Turned Mediator,"Koski Law &amp; Mediation, PLLC","My name is Lesa Koski and I am here to help you get through your divorce in as stress-less and pain-free manner. I believe that communication, trust, and compromise can help every situation end amicably. When people have these three things at their disposal, they can feel peace, calmness, empowerment, and just an overall sense that they have at least a bit of control over their lives. When you meet with me, you will find a caring, sympathetic ear that listens and you can trust. And that's the beauty of divorce mediation: you can find someone who meshes with you.
Divorce mediation is a process that enables couples to work through their issues, regardless of what has happened in the past. The goal of mediation is to aid couples in moving forward with their lives. A listening ear and an open heart are the most powerful things that a mediator can provide to a divorcing couple.
I am a state-qualified neutral who became interested in mediation during law school more than 15 years ago. I grew up in the Stillwater and Woodbury area and now live in Hudson, WI. I care about the people around me and want to see everyone leading the life they hoped they would. I believe wholeheartedly in family and divorce mediation and am dedicated to making a difficult divorce or family situation as painless as possible.
I have been mediating all my life, no matter what my job title declared. I feel that communication is very important and that most problems come from a breakdown in communication. When people can communicate and compromise, problems can be resolved.
Even when I was young, I was always looking for creative and constructive ways to help my friends and family work through their issues. Friends would consult me when they wanted advice. Family members sought out my opinion because they claimed I listened and would thoroughly contemplate their situations. So it seems only natural for me to be in this role. And more than anything, I love helping people. I want to help you get the relief and empowerment you deserve.
My office is located in Woodbury, MN, and I am here to help people from around the area move with all of their divorce issues. I help people throughout MN and WI with their divorce and co-parenting issues.

My views on divorce mediation are simple. I believe that the goal for divorcing couples is to achieve peace, calmness, and a sense that they have some control over their lives. Mediation is a lot like a swan that glides on a pond. The swan is content, calm. It glides peacefully, not necessarily happy, but not sad either. The swan is at peace, and I hope every couple who comes to me achieves this.&lt;/p&gt;

She has litigated and argued matters in both state and federal courts (including the 9th Circuit and California appellate courts) and before various governmental agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement. Ms. Garza has extensive experience in multi-plaintiff litigation, including handling significant matters in the Complex Division of the Los Angeles Superior Court representing hundreds of plaintiff/victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment. She has represented her clients in arbitrations, mediations, and complex settlement and contract negotiations. She has litigated both jury and non-jury trials to verdict.
Ms. Garza specializes in litigating matters involving individuals and employees who are victims of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, sexual assault, and all forms of prohibited discrimination. Ms. Garza has represented both minor children and adults against Fortune 500 companies, large universities, and law firms, including her recent representations of the hundreds of sexual abuse victims of university gynecologists Dr. George Tyndall and Dr. James Heaps against USC and UCLA. She is an experienced employment lawyer, representing employees in all aspects of employment litigation, such as claims of wrongful termination, retaliation, and discrimination (including race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and age). She is a former big firm employment lawyer and previously served as an independent investigator, providing neutral evaluations of claims of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation. Because of her unique experience and insight, Ms. Garza understands how companies and universities operate and attempt to prevent disclosure of important information necessary to prove claims of sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination.
Ms. Garza is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of UCLA, graduating magna cum laude in 1989 from the UCLA Honors Program with a degree in political science. While at UCLA, she played college volleyball as a middle blocker for legendary coach Andy Banachowski. She received her law degree cum laude in 1992 from the Georgetown University Law Center. After graduating from law school, Ms. Garza began her career as an attorney at the international law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp;amp; Crutcher LLP, where she was first an associate and later an equity partner in Gibson Dunn's Labor and Employment Practice Group. After spending 12 years with Gibson Dunn, Ms. Garza withdrew from the partnership to start her own law firm in 2004.
In the succeeding years, Ms. Garza developed an extensive practice representing individuals in the litigation of claims of sexual harassment, sexual abuse and employment-related misconduct. Beginning in 2006, she successfully partnered with Manly, Stewart &amp;amp; Finaldi (&ldquo;MSF&rdquo;), both as co-counsel and briefly as an employee, on several high-profile matters, including&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Jane Doe 5 v. Dr. George Tyndall and the University of Southern California.&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;Ms. Garza was one of the lead lawyers of the MSF team that served as Plaintiffs' Liaison Counsel and obtained a settlement of over $850 million for the group of 750 sexual abuse victims of USC student health center gynecologist, Dr. George Tyndall. Ms. Garza continues this partnership with MSF, with The Garza Firm serving as co-counsel in several cases, including&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Jane Doe v. Dr. James Heaps and the Regents of California.&lt;/em&gt; This recently settled lawsuit vindicates the rights of hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at the hands of UCLA gynecologist Dr. James Heaps.

These particular instances involve individuals sustaining injuries due to the failure of businesses&mdash;such as apartment complexes, shopping centers, gas stations, or restaurants&mdash;to implement sufficient security measures to safeguard their patrons and visitors.
When an unsafe property becomes the backdrop for your injury, the potential ramifications can be both physically and emotionally challenging. However, there exists a path towards seeking substantial financial recovery to address various facets of your ordeal, from medical expenses to the pain and suffering you've endured, and even the wages you may have lost as a result.
Mike Rafi's legal prowess shines particularly brightly in cases where individuals have suffered harm due to inadequate security protocols. These cases extend to scenarios where a business establishment, entrusted with ensuring the safety of those who enter its premises, falls short of its responsibilities. This could include failing to install proper lighting, neglecting to address broken security systems, or disregarding the presence of potential hazards.
By leveraging Mike Rafi's expertise, you position yourself to secure a compensation that mirrors the gravity of your situation. This can encompass not only the quantifiable expenses&mdash;such as medical bills and income loss&mdash;but also the intangible toll your suffering has taken on your quality of life.
Remember, if you have been victimized due to inadequate security measures at a business property, you possess the potential to reclaim a significant portion of what you've lost. The compensation obtained through a skilled legal approach can help you regain financial stability and promote healing. Consult with Mike Rafi and his team to explore the avenues available to you and initiate the process of seeking the reparation you deserve.

Baku Patel,reports+patel@milemarkmedia.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Baku-Patel,,,"Attorney Baku N. Patel is lead counsel in all felony criminal defense cases and personal injury/wrongful death matters at Patel Law, P.C.
&lt;h2&gt;Background &amp;amp; Education&lt;/h2&gt;
Mr. Patel was born in 1969 in Baroda, Gujarat, India. He was raised in the United States when his parents arrived from India in 1970. Mr. Patel received two bachelor degrees from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1991, one in economics and one in political science. After graduating from college, he attended the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctorate degree in 1994.
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Military Service&lt;/h2&gt;
While in law school in August of 1993, Mr. Patel was commissioned in the United States Navy as an Officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corp (JAG). Upon graduating from law school, he served on full-time active duty as a JAG Officer, where he served as a criminal defense trial attorney and as a military prosecutor. He attained the rank of Lieutenant. He then left active duty and joined the reserves, where he subsequently attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander in the Naval Reserves.
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
After leaving active military service, Mr. Patel joined the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as a trial attorney prosecuting anti-trust and consumer fraud cases. After serving as a Federal Prosecutor for the FTC, he served as a senior prosecutor for the Champaign County State's Attorney's office and in the Vermilion County State's Attorney's office. In each of those positions, Mr. Patel prosecuted numerous criminal cases to jury verdicts. After serving as senior prosecutor for both offices, Mr. Patel was then appointed by the Fifth Judicial Circuit as the Chief Public Defender of Vermilion County. He was appointed at the age of 31, making him the youngest Chief Public Defender in the State of Illinois.
Top Criminal Defense and Personal Injury Lawyer &ndash; In that capacity, Mr. Patel defended thousands of criminal cases. He also defended numerous murder trials to verdict, including death penalty cases when it was in effect. In fact, Mr. Patel was certified by the Illinois Supreme Court to be lead counsel in death penalty cases before it was abolished in Illinois. He was selected as a member of the Capital Litigation Trial Bar, which was an exclusive membership to attorneys who have exemplified jury trial experience in handling murder cases to verdict. As of today, none of Mr. Patel's client's charged with murder have been sentenced to death, nor even to life in prison. Each and every one of Mr. Patel's murder cases has resulted in either full acquittal, dismissal of charges, reduction of charges, a jury verdict for lesser included charges or parole-eligible sentences.
After serving as Chief Public Defender, Mr. Patel went into private practice, concentrating in the area of criminal defense and personal injury/wrongful death cases. In private practice, Mr. Patel has continued to represent numerous murder cases, as well as all types of felony, misdemeanor, and DUI cases. Mr. Patel has tried over 150 criminal jury trials to verdict, thereby making him one of the most experienced criminal defense attorneys in the Champaign-Urbana area. Mr. Patel has also recovered tens of millions of dollars for clients injured in auto and truck accidents, dog attacks, nursing home abuse, and medical malpractice.
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Court Trial Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
Top Criminal Defense and Personal Injury Lawyer &ndash; Mr. Patel is eligible to practice in more than just State courts; he is also a member of the Bar in Federal District Court in both the Northern and Central Districts of Illinois. In addition, in the Federal District Court of the Central District of Illinois, Mr. Patel is a panel member eligible for court appointments to represent very serious federal criminal cases. Eligibility for panel membership is determined exclusively by the Federal District Judges based on an attorney's federal trial experience. As noted above, Mr. Patel was a former Federal prosecutor both as a U.S. Navy JAG and the Federal Trade Commission. At the FTC, Mr. Patel was a trial attorney prosecuting consumer fraud cases. One of his highest-profile cases involved working closely with Canadian law enforcement to shut down one of the largest lottery scam operations in North America. Due to Mr. Patel's extensive experience in trying federal criminal cases, he was certified by the Federal District Court to be a panel member.
In addition, he has routinely been privately retained by those charged with very serious federal matters. He has defended federal narcotics charges, gun charges, environmental pollution cases, real estate fraud, child pornography, and securities fraud. Each of these cases involved thousands and thousands of pages of evidence and extensive investigation resulting in successful outcomes that well exceeded the client's expectations. Due to the complexity of federal criminal defense, Mr. Patel is uniquely qualified to represent those charged with such serious matters in federal court.
Mr. Patel truly believes in utilizing all of his experience to defend the rights of clients to the fullest extent of the law. He will aggressively defend his clients and rely on his jury trial experience to protect their freedoms. He is also supported by a strong legal team that works together on every client's case. If you are in need of aggressive representation, whether fighting the State or U.S. Government or taking on insurance companies, contact attorney Baku Patel at Patel Law, PC for a free case evaluation.
Baku and his wife reside in Urbana, IL. His oldest son is currently&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://navyoutreach.blogspot.com/2018/10/urbana-native-trains-to-become-future.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy.&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;His youngest son is attending college.

","I offer participants&nbsp; a structured and supportive environment to explore and resolve their issues and provide them with the tools from my legal toolkit so that each participant understands their rights and options within the legal system.&nbsp; At the request of participants I will offer predictive outcomes based on my 40 years of legal experience in the event that the parties are unable to resolve their dispute and elect to proceed to court.&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction: I will explain the mediation process and the roles and responsibilities of the parties.    This is often done in a group setting, but it can be done individually.&lt;/p&gt;
Opening statements: Each party will have the opportunity to make an opening statement to explain their perspective on the dispute.    This is optional, and if you choose not to do this, it will not affect the success of the mediation.&lt;/p&gt;
Individual Breakout Sessions:    I will usually meet with each party in a private session to discuss the dispute further, identify concerns and interests, and to explore options for resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
Joint sessions: In some cases, I will meet with the parties in a joint session to discuss the dispute and identify the issues that need to be resolved. This usually happens after a few individual sessions with each party.&lt;/p&gt;
Negotiation: I will work with each party, individually and jointly, to negotiate an agreement that addresses concerns and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
Arbitration Option: Participants will have the option to use the mediator in an arbitration role to allow the mediator to serve as an arbitrator to resolve specific issues in dispute. Both parties must agree to this option and also agree that the decision made in this process is binding and not subject to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
Closure: If an agreement is reached, I will help you to formalize the agreement in a written document.  If you do not have an attorney, I can help you prepare the essential legal documents, help you file them with the court, and ensure they are signed and effective. If no agreement is reached, you may consider other options for resolving the dispute, such as arbitration or litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

","Our primary interest is helping people resolve their dissolution disputes through settlement. This method allows the marital partners themselves to decide their future by making agreements concerning their children, support and assets &amp;#8211; rather than to have to live by the decisions made by another person. If parties have taken an active part in determining vitally important aspects of their future and the futures of their children, they can experience an easier time adapting to the major changes a divorce brings to a family, allowing them to move forward in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
Mediation can successfully resolve your dissolution of marriage if you and your marital partner: are respectful of one another; are honest with all assets, debts, income, expenses and any facts which have relevance to your children; are motivated to end the financial entanglements; and are responsive and cooperative with requests for material, information, and documents requested by the mediator and by one another.&lt;/p&gt;
Please Note . . .  
If you or your partner are excessively angry toward one another; have a desire to hurt the other partner; cannot speak to one another; have been the victim of domestic violence; or you cannot trust your marital partner to be open and honest with the nature and extent of the assets, debts, and income, then mediation is probably NOT a viable alternative for your case.&lt;/p&gt;

Mary Sanger,mary.sanger@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Mary-Sanger,Founding Partner,Insights Collaboritive Therapy.com,"Returning to school later in life, counseling became a second career for me. I have been practicing as a Marriage and Family Therapist, Licensed Professional Counselor, and Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselor for 20 years.&nbsp;After witnessing the pain caused to so many families during the process of traditional divorce, I became trained in family law mediation, parent coordinating, and collaborative divorce in order to provide a kinder, more thoughtful option for families going through divorce. The focus of my practice is with individuals and couples considering divorce or in the process of divorcing, and co-parents.
I provide individuals and couples who want to end their marriage with a process that will allow them to transition their family with a minimal amount of damage, emotionally.&nbsp; It's not just the loss of relationship that damages people but the degree of conflict that happens in the divorce which causes the most damage. I coach and help couples understand the complexities of the divorce process, create a parenting plan that keeps their children front and enter, and helps individuals bring their best selves to the process.
When preparing for divorce, clients often bring strong emotions to the process, which can interfere with the productive resolution of issues. People want to be heard. It's the reason why so many people say, &ldquo;I just want my day in court.&rdquo; Therapists are trained to closely follow a client's narrative and listen to their stories. Therefore, skills I bring to the mediation process make it less likely that I as the mediator will become impatient with a disputant's pace or attempt to rush the process. Moreover, I as a therapist am trained to simultaneously attend to content and process of communication during mediation. The pain that people experience during divorce usually has more to do with the inherent adversarial nature of a traditional divorce, rather than the loss of the relationship.
In 2011 I founded Insights Collaborative Therapy Group in Dallas, Texas. Insights is a highly-respected professional practice providing comprehensive collaborative mediation and theraputic profesional services. Today I am one of four partners at Insights.

Divorce Coaching and Therapy Sessions: $310&lt;/p&gt;
",,"I provide party only mediation services because I understand that dealing with conflict, divorce, and change is hard and filled with difficult emotions. I believe in helping clients bring the best of themselves to the mediation table and empowering clients to be active participants in making decisions about their lives &ndash; leading to better, longer lasting settlement agreements. A marriage and family therapist is uniquely trained to help people regulate their emotions during difficult processes and allows for an openness that vastly improves the negotiation process. Settlements are achieved in a cooler, calmer emotional environment.&lt;/p&gt;
Mediation is a process that brings people in conflict together with a neutral third person who assists them in reaching a voluntary agreement. I help you prepare for mediation, clarify the issues, consider options, and reach a workable settlement that fits their needs. Mediation gives people a relatively quick, inexpensive way to work out their differences while addressing everyone's needs and interests. Decisions reached in mediation are created by the parties involved, not by the mediator or a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
I encourage direct communication between the parties and help people decide for themselves the best settlement. It allows for the expression of emotions, often defuses anger, explores creative means of solving problems, and promotes cooperation between people. My style is especially beneficial in situations where there will be an ongoing relationship because the process helps preserve the strengths of a relationship. It often helps people accept the consequences of their own decisions, be open to change, and develops a model for resolution of future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

Wolfgang Florin,reports+florin@milemarkmedia.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Wolfgang-Florin,Tampa Personal Injury Lawyer,Florin Gray,"I was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana to my parents who had less than a decade earlier emigrated to the United States from Salzburg, Austria. They had no jobs and neither could speak English. Perhaps, like most children, I didn't appreciate until I matured the tremendous influence my parents had on shaping my beliefs and values. I learned from their experience that despite adversity, with passion, determination, a strong work ethic, and, most importantly, a respect for others, you can achieve fulfillment.
My first passion, perhaps because of my height of 6'7&Prime; and Indiana upbringing, was basketball. My success, fueled by my parents' values, led me to receive offers to play collegiately at institutions throughout the United States. I attended Cornell University where I graduated from the School of Hotel Administration, long regarded as the best hospitality school in the world. At Cornell, I earned GTE Academic All American and All-Ivy League honors while on the basketball team. It is at Cornell that I developed my next passion &ndash; Food &amp;amp; Beverage and the intense focus on providing quality service to others. While I worked at some highly regarded hotels and restaurants in both New York and Florida, it is the training relating to service to others that led me to law school.
In 1991, I graduated from the University of Florida College of Law. I spent the first 5 years of my legal career working primarily as a professional malpractice defense attorney, at the Tampa law firm of Annis, Mitchell, Cockey, Edwards, and Roehn. Although I was well trained by a firm of highly skilled attorneys and learned the foundational legal skills desired by all new lawyers, saving large corporations money never quite provided me with the desired level of personal and professional satisfaction. In 1996, I departed Annis, Mitchell to join my brother as well as law school classmate, Chris Gray, to develop an Employee Rights practice dedicated to assisting victims of workplace harassment, bullying, discrimination, and broken promises, and to aid people wronged, tormented, abused, belittled, or underpaid at their place of work.
For almost a quarter-century, I have largely dedicated my professional life in service to such victims and, over time, have learned the real value of the hospitality service education and training I received. While providing a high-quality hospitality service experience to someone during their restaurant visit or hotel stay was professionally rewarding to me, I have found no greater professional fulfillment than providing high-quality legal service and achieving corrective results for individuals who have suffered unlawful treatment at the hands of their employers. I have counseled thousands of individuals. I have achieved multiple million-dollar recoveries for my clients. And, while proud of those results, when clients occasionally question whether the size of their loss sufficiently warrants my undertaking of their case, I quickly reflect that, over the years, some of the smallest monetary recoveries have had the most profound and significant impact on altering or affecting my clients' life circumstances. For over two decades, I have passionately provided service in the protection of Employee Rights and, during that time, have been fortunate and humbled to receive various peer and professional accolades:
&lt;ul&gt;
 - I was among the first group of lawyers in the State of Florida to attain Board Certification in the area of Labor and Employment law.

Carmen uses her extensive mediation experience and training to help you bridge your differences and reach an agreement, without being subjected to a court proceeding beyond your control.
In the family law realm, divorce is tremendously unsettling. It is an emotional and difficult process, but &lt;strong&gt;it does not have to be adversarial&lt;/strong&gt;. She guides you through the divorce process, as well as any custody or visitation questions, at your pace, keeping in mind that this can be an overwhelming process, but with the knowledge that both your concerns and matters that you may not have even considered will be addressed.
For commercial cases, Carmen relies on her years practicing commercial law in the areas of corporate securities, real estate, and trust and estates. Commercial disputes can be complicated and at times emotional, but by their very nature mediation offers a way to address them in a way that provides each party an opportunity to offer and consider reasonable and creative compromises.
Carmen also &lt;strong&gt;speaks Spanish fluently&lt;/strong&gt; and firmly believes that all parties should be able to represent themselves in the language in which they feel most comfortable.
Carmen graduated from &lt;strong&gt;Brown University&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Columbia Law School&lt;/strong&gt;.&nbsp; After practicing law, Carmen made the decision to pursue a more compassionate and caring practice where she could apply her legal skills to everyone's benefit.

Divorce or separation is emotional, complex, and can be very expensive.&nbsp; Carmen believes that everyone is entitled to experienced legal and mediation services.&lt;/p&gt;
The fee structure is based on the couple's combined gross income as reported in their tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;
Before proceeding with any work, we agree upon an hourly rate. There will always be complete transparency with respect to costs.&lt;/p&gt;
Depending on the assets, such as a home, condo, coop, pensions, retirement plans, cars, and business interests, there could be between 5 and 8 mediation sessions. The fewer the assets, the less complex the case typically is, and thus the faster it is to address these issues.&nbsp; Each mediation session is generally scheduled for 2 hours, but, on occasion, they could be shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

","Carmen understands that you are in the best position to understand your needs. She is there to facilitate the conversation to help you reach an amicable agreement. No one is better qualified than you to make those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
This philosophy is the same in commercial, family law, and divorce cases. Mediation affords the parties the opportunity to speak and be heard in a confidential setting. With or without counsel, mediation gives each party a more informal but focused platform to voice their grievances, without losing sight of the opportunity to achieve workable and lasting solutions to disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
On family law and divorce cases, Carmen has worked with married and unmarried couples, with and without children, and with parties with different sexual orientations and identities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mcSide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;mcH2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Criminal Defense Lawyer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
After many years of working as a prosecutor, I realized my strengths and desires were more in line with defending people's rights than with prosecuting defendants. I earnestly wanted to help defend those rights guaranteed by the Constitution. I understand that most people who have been charged with a crime are not bad people; they have just found themselves in a bad situation. Today, I use the knowledge gained as a Prosecutor to go to bat for my clients.
&lt;h2&gt;Experience You Can Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
When I accept a criminal defense case, I do whatever it takes to build a strong defense. Your future, your rights, and your freedom are made possible by executing a strong defense. Whenever possible, I move to reduce or dismiss charges. If a negotiated settlement is not in your best interest, I will not hesitate to go to trial before a jury. I use successful strategies and knowledge developed during many years as a former prosecutor to provide what my clients need.  
Through my broad experience inside and outside of the courtroom, I am able to provide efficient and effective legal services to obtain positive results. Whether you are seeking criminal representation, compensation for a personal injury case, or a resolution to a legal dispute, we will remain advocates for you throughout your case and never settle unless it is with your permission, and in your best interest. As skilled negotiators, our firm is prepared to take any case to trial.

Aaron Zeman,azeman@smu.edu,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Aaron-Zeman,Director,"Bertram-Zeman, LLC","Aaron B. Zeman is a mediator credentialed by the Texas Mediator Credentialing Association and received a Master of Arts in Dispute Resolution from SMU's Simmons School and is a member of the American Arbitration Association. Aaron established Oak Cliff Conflict Management Group (OCCM) in 2022. OCCM seeks to provide mediation and conflict coaching to communities underserved by traditional Dispute Resolution practitioners.
Aaron was born in Pecos, TX, but he   grew-up   in Pecos, Lubbock, Pecos (again), Fredericksburg, Temple, Belton, College Station, San Antonio, and Dallas. As the product of a contentious divorce, bad mediation is something with which Aaron is familiar and understands how much wasted time and energy we can devote to issues that do not really matter. Aaron's   vida loca   taught him to appreciate that conflict can be a creative force, and that endings are not always bad.
Aaron received a degree in Business Management from Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station, TX in 2007. He worked in corporate benefits consulting and employee compensation analysis for over a decade before returning to school. He began his graduate studies at the University of Dallas in Irving, TX in 2018 where he completed his studies in Psychology in 2020. Aaron finished his Master of Arts in Dispute Resolution from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX in 2023. Aaron Zeman is a doctoral candidate at SMU, studying historical responses to shared trauma, from a conflict engagement perspective.
Aaron lives with his partner in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas. They have a very opinionated black cat named Dorito. Aaron and Dane are addicted to college sports, but they are also active members at First Presbyterian Church (USA) of Dallas. They actively support the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and UKirk SMU.
Bertram-Zeman, LLC was established in 2022 and provides employee compensation analysis and internal dispute mitigation system design and consulting services.
Primary Counties of focus: Dallas County, Tarrant County, Brazos County, and Reeves County, Texas.

Moreover, as these positive dynamics feed into each other, the interaction can regenerate and assume a constructive, connecting, and humanizing character. The model assumes that the transformation of the interaction itself is what matters most to parties in conflict &ndash; even more than settlement&nbsp;on favorable terms. Therefore, the theory defines the mediator's goal as helping the parties to identify opportunities for empowerment and recognition shifts as they arise in the parties' conversation, to choose whether and how to act upon these opportunities, and thus to change their interaction from destructive to constructive (Bush &amp;amp; Pope, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
A transformative mediator should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 - Be comfortable with conflict, including strong emotion and negative communication patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Respect the choices of the parties, including their choice to participate in the mediation. This should be done even if the mediator does not personally agree with the choice the parties are making.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Be comfortable with a limited understanding of the parties' conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Respect the parties, even if their actions, appearance, language, and attitudes seem completely different from those of the mediator.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Be patient with the parties and the process of their interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Focus on the moment by moment events in the parties' interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Attend to empowerment and recognition opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Choose interventions (and non-interventions) based upon opportunities for party empowerment and/or recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
 - Relinquish problem solving and control of the process.&lt;/li&gt;

",,"Our goal in all mediations is to create a relaxed atmosphere, where everyone involved is comfortable and understands the process. This decreases the adversarial nature of the dispute and increases the chances of an agreement being reached. The goal of mediation is for everyone to part amicably, regardless of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
Our approach varies depending on the situation, but you can usually expect to start together in a Zoom meeting, and then breaking out into caucus (small groups) to discuss. Everyone can be brought together at any time upon request, and everyone will be brought together at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

The breadth of experience within our team is noteworthy, ranging from a minimum of 3 years of dedicated solo mediation practice for our least experienced mediator, to a median experience level of 12 years among our mediators, and an impressive 30+ years of experience held by our most seasoned mediator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;A significant factor contributing to the depth of expertise within our team is the extensive volunteer work undertaken by the majority of our mediators, either in the past or ongoing, providing mediation services to local courts. This commitment has exposed them to a diverse array of mediation and settlement scenarios, thereby enriching their skill set and knowledge base. In addition to their volunteer work, our mediators have also amassed substantial experience through their contractual and private practice endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;This diverse experience has uniquely positioned our mediators as experts in several crucial aspects of mediation. They excel in drafting legally binding agreements, adeptly facilitating negotiations and fostering effective communication among parties, and ensuring that all involved parties are comprehensively informed and empowered throughout the mediation process. This wealth of experience, coupled with their commitment to diversity and inclusivity, underscores our team's exceptional ability to navigate complex mediation situations with professionalism and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

What sets our team apart is their exceptional ability to adapt seamlessly to the specific dynamics and atmosphere of each mediation session, ensuring a harmonious and effective process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Irrespective of their individual styles, all our mediators maintain a steadfast commitment to the core principles of mediation. They remain impartial, allowing clients to retain decision-making authority, safeguarding the confidentiality of all proceedings, and empowering all parties with the information and autonomy necessary to exercise self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;

We have more information about their educational backgrounds in their short bios on our   Resources for Mediation   page. These interpreters cover an impressive array of languages, including Spanish, French, Creole, Arabic, Mandarin, Swahili, Kinyarwanda, and Cantonese. We are also actively working on expanding our language offerings to better serve our diverse clientele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Our team of remote notaries is small, but we are working on adding more once the demand exceeds the availability we have currently. Each notary we have is not only approved by their state Governor to provide notary services locally, but have also met the educational requirements to become certified and provide &lt;strong&gt;remote notary&lt;/strong&gt; services all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Remarkably, our mediation team alone possesses the linguistic capacity to accommodate nine different languages other than English, exemplifying our dedication to inclusivity and effective communication in mediation. Those languages are French; Spanish; Arabic; Farsi; Portuguese; Hindi; Lingala; and, Tshiluba.&lt;/p&gt;

She is recognized internationally for her insightful and experiential approach to teaching and managing conflict, and has been welcomed as a trainer throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Jacinta's innovative resources, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intwohomes.com/&quot;&gt;Our Family in Two Homes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://intwohomes.com/products/relationship-pack&quot;&gt;Designing Our Future Together&lt;/a&gt; help clients prepare to engage deeply, and productively, with Family Lawyers, Mediators and Collaborative Practitioners.
In 2017, Jacinta transformed her mediation practice by studying and applying the Insight Approach to her work. She created a comprehensive Insight Mediation training program, The Curious Mediator, which dives deeply into a relational definition of conflict and helps mediators work with targeted curiosity to help parties gain insight and change their patterns of behaviour to open up pathways to understanding. &nbsp;Not quite a magic wand &amp;#8211; but almost! &nbsp;Mediators and collaborative professionals who learn the Insight Approach say things like,   Finally &amp;#8211; this makes sense of what I see and experience in the room.  ,   This learning is exhilarating.   and   I wish we had known this 20 years ago!  
Jacinta's podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacintagallant.ca/Blog&quot;&gt;The Authentic Professional,&lt;/a&gt; focuses on how professionals can bring more of who they are to what they do, and her latest book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goingsteadytoolkit.com/&quot;&gt;Going Steady&lt;/a&gt;, helps engage couples in conversations that sustain and nourish their relationship. Jacinta's ultimate goal is to help conflict professionals engage with clients in a more meaningful way, manage conflict more effectively, and get more enjoyment out of this important work.

","&lt;div&gt;
The Insight Approach is the foundation of all my work. Described as the   fourth pillar   of conflict resolution, Insight Mediation seeks to understand and work with the human behaviours that get in the way of productive dialogue. &nbsp;The Insight Approach defines conflict from a social/relational theory as a pattern of behaviours that block learning and openness. &nbsp;Insight Mediators use targeted curiosity to explore the threats that are causing the conflict behaviours, so that destructive patterns of behaviour can be understood and changed. We see these behaviours as a natural human response to a perception of threat. &nbsp; Rather than containing or correcting the behaviours, we help clients gain insight and clarify meaning. &nbsp;All of this is more productive and efficient as we are getting to the heart of the matter &amp;#8211; and the conflict behaviours that block dialogue, so clients can make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
Facilitative. &nbsp;Client-centred. &nbsp;Consensual Dispute Resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

Ann Groninger,linkbuildjg@gmail.com,,,Johnson &amp, Groninger PLLC,"Many people use the terms &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and &ldquo;crash&rdquo; interchangeably, but the terms have different meanings. It's important to understand the difference if you want to bring a lawsuit against another driver and obtain full compensation.The word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; implies no one is at fault, while &ldquo;crash&rdquo; suggests someone else is responsible, and is therefore &ldquo;liable&rdquo; for paying for the damages that you experienced as a result of the collision.Crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks are especially dangerous because of their enormous size and weight. Getting hit by one of these commercial semis can result in serious and sometimes permanent injuries.In a collision with a truck or other commercial vehicle?

Willow McLean,willowmclean@gmail.com,https://mediate.com/mediator-profile/Willow-McLean,"Social Worker, Mediator, and Voice of the Child Practitioner",Atlantic Family Mediation,"&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;I am a registered social worker and have worked in the field of child protection, child and adolescent mental health, and child and family well being in Nova Scotia for over 15 years. During this time I have witnessed the amazing amount of strength, creativity, and resiliency that families in Nova Scotia possess. I have seen the great lengths that parents will go to to make sure their children are healthy, happy, and protected. I have been privileged to hear peoples' stories and to provide support and assistance during difficult times in their lives.
&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wixGuard&quot;&gt;Although family separations can be extremely stressful and difficult times for both parents and children, they DON'T have to involve court battles, high conflict, or huge expenses. If you are dealing with conflict over living arrangements, parenting time, child support, or other parenting concerns, I can help. With the right support, information, and guidance, I truly believe that most families can work through their parenting and support issues together, and come to a practical and sustainable solutions for themselves and their children.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;My job as a social worker and mediator is to provide a flexible process, reliable information, thoughtful guidance, and a safe space for parents to have the discussions that they need to for their children. &lt;span class=&quot;wixGuard&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Please reach out to me by phone or email, I'm happy to discuss your individual situation, answer any questions about the mediation process, or even provide referrals to other service providers if it turns out mediation is not the right process for you.

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
With years of experience in conflict resolution, my vision has been to create a platform where individuals, communities, and organizations can find effective solutions to their conflicts.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Background&lt;/h3&gt;
My background is steeped in the fields of mediation, somatic trauma therapy and community engagement. I hold a Master's degree in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution from Columbia University's School of Professional Studies.
With a lifelong commitment to cultivate a culture where conflict is no longer seen as a hindrance to progress, but rather an opportunity for positive social change. I strive to empower people of color to embrace conflict, difference and &nbsp;the healing of trauma as a means of sustaining interpersonal relationships.
I've worked in various domains including organizational mediation, community disputes, family conflicts, landlord-tenant mediation, restorative justice programs, coaching and training. My diverse experience has shaped my approach, combining empathy, dialogue, and trauma-based support to create tailored solutions.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Approach &amp;amp; Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;
My approach to conflict resolution is founded on empathy, dialogue, and a profound understanding of human relationships. By addressing the underlying issues and emotions that fuel disputes, I guide all parties towards a lasting resolution that respects individual needs and values. My philosophy is succinctly captured in the belief that &ldquo;Conflict is not a barrier, but a gateway to understanding and growth.&rdquo; Rather than seeing disputes as obstacles, I view them as opportunities to strengthen relationships, build bridges, and promote personal &amp;amp; communal growth.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Fischer does not limit her practice to a specific area of law. What she offers clients is not predictive knowledge of likely judicial outcomes.&nbsp; Instead, she offers a client-centered process that prioritizes creating a safe space in which each participant can feel heard and take an active role in determining the way forward.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;As a woman and a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Fischer has an appreciation for the fact that many individuals and communities do not feel confident that they will be empowered and treated well in a courtroom or traditional law office.&nbsp; It is at the heart of the Thresholds LLC mission to provide a place where each person can feel supported in their humanity, dignity, and autonomy as they work to move through the threshold of their conflict or transition to what is on the other side.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;For clients who have demonstrable financial need, Fischer reserves one mediation session each month that is available at a scaled rate.&lt;/span&gt;

Manz,"Angela is the leader of The Manz Law Firm pack, with the key purpose of helping clients achieve two main goals: planning for the future and coping during times of crisis. Angela graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and acquired her Juris Doctorate at the College of William and Mary Marshall Wythe School of Law.
Having practiced for over a decade, Angela focuses her firm's efforts on estate planning and helping families obtain Medicaid and Veterans Administration benefits to pay for long-term care. Angela dedicates her time, energy and legal expertise to helping you and your loved ones prepare to retire and live comfortably, and to helping make your money last to pay for care and possibly leaving an inheritance for your children.
Angela has first-hand experience with taking care of a loved one. Angela lived with her grandparents during her teen years and helped to care for her great-grandmother, who lived with them also, and who had physical and cognitive needs. She knows first hand the struggle of having to place a loved one into a nursing home. Angela also helped to personally care for her grandfather, grandmother and then her father before they finally reached their heavenly home.
In the office, Angela provides a defensive backbone and iron-fisted leadership, along with an inexhaustible supply of quick wit and offbeat jokes that every office needs. Angela is the mother of an amazing and witty daughter and the wife of a retired Navy Chief. When she's not planning your future or assisting with other legal matters, you can find her reading a never-ending supply of books (and donating to the library with her late fees), helping her grandmother use Facebook, and plucking at the banjo &ndash; slowly, but surely.
Angela tells all of our families: &ldquo;Getting older is a team sport.&rdquo; And we would love to be on your family's team to help you work through these difficult times.
